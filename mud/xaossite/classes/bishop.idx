The bishop, the most devoted followers a religion could ever have, clerics
who have decided they shall devote themselves to the religious duties
of thier patron will probably opt to become bishops at the proper time,
fore they are the closest link the gods have to the mortal world and will
often be the first to act on the wihes of thier patron.
