The Enchanter is perhaps the most un adventurous of the many specialist mage
forms, they would perfer to sit deep within thier tower, working away upon
some new and ultimately powerful object. Thier spells are completely based
around taking a material component and making it even better. No army is
complete without at least one of these tinkering souls in the background
somewhere enchanting thier arsenal. Do not be fooled however, an enchanter
is far from defenseless, even a common object could be brought against an
opponent in a flurry of attacks.
