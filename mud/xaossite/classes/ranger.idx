The Ranger is a lone warrior, set forth to wander the lands.  While in the
woods and deep swamps a ranger has the ability to mask themself from
detection.  As well, a ranger can call animals to their aid while in the
wilderness, giving them a useful ally in combat and a loyal companion in
thier travels.  They can find food almost anywhere, allowing them to be
completely self-sufficient and visits to a city or settlement are required
rarely.
