The berserker is a warrior specialization that trolls and trolls alone may
train to become.  The berserkers have many skills that make them a deadly
opponent who's prowess with weaponry and brutal force crush anything in
thier blood lusting path.  With a desire to inflict pain above that of the
already hungry trolls, the berserker in combat may feel charges of extreme
anger and the following attack is truely devastating.  Also they have
developed a better understanding of how to manipulate the rubbery skin
upon thier very bones to infact harden it further into an almost rock like
state.  Those elements mixed with other primal fighting tactics make them
a powerful and highly feared enemy.
