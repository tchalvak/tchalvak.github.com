The necromancer, the most vile of mage professions, defiling anything they
see fit, ressurecting anyone they deem useful.  Nothing may rest in peace
while these terrifying black robed figures exist.  Thier magic focuses
upon death, and every element of it.  They are the scourge of the living,
summoning great hordes of undead to serve them and ultimately they often
choose to become one themselves.  Only black hearted mages have the cold
will to stomach these teachings.
