The knight is a master of tactical combat, while the code of honour which
once ruled the actions of this elite group has all but vanished the
teachings and training to become a one remains. The knight focuses thier
personal combat with the sword & spear, able to utilize either with greater
effectiveness then any other class. There is nothing more commanding on the
field of war then a full suite of knights charging into the thick of combat
and laying waste to all opposition.
