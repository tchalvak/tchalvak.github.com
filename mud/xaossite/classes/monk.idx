Monks are priests who combine the force of their own will with their
connection to their god concentrate on combat that does not include weapons,
though some have complimented their hand to hand training with nunchaku.
Their prayers are used to strengthen their own abilities.  They practice
martial arts and extreme forms of control of their own mental processes,
seeking purity. Holy Ritual and meditation are their meat and bread.  They
usually are very serene and tolerant of others, however, challenging or
threatening a monk will usually earn one a quick thrashing, if not worse.
