As a true child of Aaeran, the Seeress is a master of her mind and others. 
The will of her goddess allows her powers to force others to her will, so
that she may better prove the dominance of drow race. Though all drow
support the use of slavery, the Seeress takes that support to a new level,
able to bend the will of those she wishes to do her bidding. If that does
not work, Aaeran has blessed her with the skills to use whips to better
convince others of her point of view. She has also become adept in the
sacrificial arts that are so important to gain and maintain the favour of
Aaeran, and carries her skills with daggers to the defense of the drow. It
is through the blending of these skills that makes the Seeress not only one
to fear with the mind, but with the body.
