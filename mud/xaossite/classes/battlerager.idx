The Battlerager is an insane fighter of dwarven legend, a testament to the
dwarven kind, these warriors are the most fierce in the lands. The secret to
a battle rager is thier mastery of the rage, a mythical style of fighting
which applies absolutely no effort to defend, instead using the simple rule
of what is dead, cannot hurt you. The 'Rager is of course only a dwarven
subclass of warrior.
