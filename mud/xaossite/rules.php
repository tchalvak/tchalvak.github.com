<center><b>The Core Player Rules of XaosMUD</b></center>
<p>

<i>Respect the role playing modes...</i><br>
If you are either in either RP or HCRP mode respect its rules and its 
policies of being role playing enforced.  Out of character communications 
are respectfully kept to the proper channels and should not ever leak out 
into in-character environments.  As of this written gtell and the ooc 
channel are the only accepted methods of out of character talk, please 
communicate as your character would in any other fasion and do use terms 
that are uncharacterizable such as statistics or specific numbers and 
affects.  Quickie notes which RP less then a day's timeframe(bypassing tells) are unacceptable.
Notice:  Type <b>help hcrprules</b> for rules specific to roleplaying.
<p>

<i>Only Pkill if and when role playing justifies it...</i><br>
This is not a PK mud, it is a role playing mud.  We are very lax on the 
limitations of what can and cannot be done during a player fight but at 
the same time require that if you do participate in player conflicts that 
your character has justification for doing so.  Beyond this rule even if 
you are playing a mass murderer, do not ruin it for everyone, the gods and 
can will take actions to curb excessive player killing.
<p>

<i>Do not Idle...</i><br>
There is a difference between active playing and scripted or otherwise 
idle behavior, that difference is the player does not respond to 
interactions from the mud if they are idling.  Idling by definition is the 
failiure to give a live response to communications specifically by 
immortals within a reasonably time frame, this is typically five minutes 
or so.  In addendum, the AFK flag does not make you immune to this, you 
use AFK to globally signal your status but the same time frame still 
applies, if you must leave the game for more then these periods of time it 
is always best to quit the character, due to the unfair nature of scripted 
idling judges will not hesitate to permanently remove idlers from the game.
<p>

<i>Do not multiplay...</i><br>
Any form of interaction between two or more of your own characters by any 
means is strictly forbidden.  Sharing of equipment, information or other 
gains is frowned upon heavily and while the game has certain aspects of
this illegal activity monitored and evokes automatic charges, the ideals 
of this rule are above all not to be ignored.
<p>

<i>Do not exploit bugs...</i><br>
When a mistake is made and something happens in the game that should not 
occur please do not work to abuse it but instead report it.  Essentially 
if you think something is a bug and even if not abusable please report it 
via the bug spool, you help the mud and you insure the activity is 
resolved.  Being caught abusing a bug is a likely cause for your siteban, 
please don't push this one.
<p>

<i>Do not ask the immortals to cheat for you...</i><br>
Even just jokily please do not ask an immortal to use thier influence to 
cheat for you or in general abuse thier position for less then noble 
gains.  This includes asking for increased experience...you know who you 
are.
<p>

<i>Please act responsibly and maturely</i><br>
This rule covers out of character activity more then any, respect other's 
feelings and thier desire to have a good time playing this game.  Spamming 
global channels or harassment of any serious kind is unacceptable.  
Playing this game may not be a right, but it is something that we try to 
let everyone be able to do without harassment.  Please refrain from 
making homophobic, racist and even sexist remarks, they are not welcome 
here.  At the same time remember that a joke is a joke and while its 
important to be able to find the humour in life taking it too far will 
cross the line between funny and ignorant.  On a personal addition to this 
rule, I Ragnar do not tolerate the above mentioned behaviors, and I will 
personally throw out anyone who does not respect this.
<p>

<i>Anything else...?</i><br>
If you believe there is something that could/should be added to this list
and wish to bring it up, refer your idea to the immortals.  Also if an 
immortal deems your actions as 'cheating' and those actions were not 
covered here, you can appeal your case to the Judges in general and the 
results will vary, however the constant is they are judges and thier 
authority must be respected unless otherwise dictated by a higher  
power.  Please try to keep any arguments against judgements as  
constructive, relevant and well thought out as possible, whining will 
function only to damage your reputation and make your case that much 
weaker.
<p>

<b>Remember:</b>  These rules may not be perfect, but they are what exists, 
please abide by them or type quit, its your choice and always will be your 
choice.
