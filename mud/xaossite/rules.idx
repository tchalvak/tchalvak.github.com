      <i><b>Respect the role playing modes</i></b><br>
      If you are either in either RP or HCRP mode respect its rules and its 
      policies of being role playing enforced.  Out of character communications 
      are respectfully kept to the proper channels and should not ever leak out 
      into in-character environments.  As of this written gtell and the ooc 
      channel are the only accepted methods of out of character talk, please 
      communicate as your character would in any other fasion and do use terms 
      that are uncharacterizable such as statistics or specific numbers and 
      affects.  Quickie notes which RP less then a day's timeframe(bypassing tells) are unacceptable.
      

      <p><b><i>Only Pkill if and when role playing justifies it</b></i><br>
      This is not a PK mud, it is a role playing mud.  We are very lax on the 
      limitations of what can and cannot be done during a player fight but at 
      the same time require that if you do participate in player conflicts that 
      your character has justification for doing so.  Beyond this rule even if 
      you are playing a mass murderer, do not ruin it for everyone, the gods and 
      can will take actions to curb excessive player killing.
      
      <p><b><i>Act your alignment.</b></i><br>
      Good people don't kill innocents or people who aren't threats to life and
      liberty.  But they aren't necessarily pacifists either.  Much like evil
      characters aren't required to be murderous felons, preying on small children
      or defenseless and toothless old men.  In fact, evil people can be (outwardly)
      nice and great people.  Remember, alignment isn't meant to be restricting, but
      more of a tool to start explaining a character's personality.
 
      <p><b><i>Act your race.</b></i><br>
      Certainly, what race your character is influences how the character behaves to
      some extent.  Dwarves will disdain (wizardly) magics, trolls will rarely be
      courteous, elves will enjoy nature and kender will delight in pranks.  However,
      this does not absolutely require one to be like all others of your race.  There
      are exceptions.  But these exceptions to the rule still are that race, and
      certain things will always be inalienable.
