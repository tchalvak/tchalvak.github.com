<b>Welcome to Xaos!</b>
<p>
<h1><b>Using other clients:</b></h1>
<p>
<b>[Suggested connection method for new mudders]:</b> (Requires no software installation or registration, but is initially a little more complex to set up)
<br>-Gmud- "http://www.geneseo.edu/~ror1/e/Gmud.exe"; 350 KB Download; can run anywhere; from the web, from a floppy, or from the hard- drive; no registration necessary; has color, aliases, triggers, essentially all necessary features available.
<p>
Download GMUD from "http://www.geneseo.edu/~ror1/e/Gmud.exe".
<br>Run the "Gmud.exe" program.
<br>From the "File" option of the top menu, select "Connect".
<br>Click the "Add" button and name the the world "Xaos", then hit "OK".
<br>For "Host," type: xaos.ath.cx 
<br>For "Port", type: 5000 
<br>Click the "Connect" button to connect to Xaos.
<p>
Optional but suggested:
<br>Give yourself more viewing room by clicking "View" in the upper menu and then unchecking "Connected World Window," "Macro Window," and "Status Bar".
<br>Click on "Options" in the menu, then "Screen Wrap" and change the options to "Wrap to screen" and "word".
<br>Click on "Options" again, then "Font" and change the font to "Courier New", the style to "Regular", and the size to "10".
<p>
<br><b>[Best Long-Term mudding client]:</b> (Newer versions eventually require a twenty dollar one-time payment, and software installation is necessary.)
<br>-Zmud-  "http://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/zmudinfo.htm"; unable to run without being installed onto about 7 MB of hard-drive space; all the features you could ever need and much more; 30-day trial before it stops working unless you pay the 25$ registration fee.
<p>
<b>[Other windows mudclients available]:</b>
<p>
-Putty- "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html"; 220 KB Download; can run on the spot, from a floppy, or from the hard-drive; much better than telnet, though it doesn't have any features designed specifically for muds.
<p>
-Other windows programs-: wintin; mud-master; zmud 3.62; mudzilla, and many more.  (Google search for "download {mudclient name}")
<p>
<b>[For Macs]:</b>
<p>
-Rapscallion- "http://www.rapscallion.co.uk"; unable to run without being installed onto about 2.2 MB of hard-drive space; a number of features.
<p>
<br>(If any of the programs are missing from those websites above sites, simply do a google search for "download {whatever the name of the mudclient is}" instead.)
