Well, it's done.  Certain information had to be fudged, and a couple of sections are empty for now (see: Story Archive).  Also fixed the mysterious red X of doom that was showing
up on the last page of each gallery.
<p>Updated Deities page (War, Varseg, and The Goddess added; Seht, Black Draconis, and Saxon removed).
<br>Updated Classes page (Seeress added, woops).
<br>Factions page updated (Order of the Crimson Moon removed).
