The Vulcanian Prefecture
========================
It is widely known throughout Terra, that the deserts belong to the
proud and noble Fire Giants, a race of giant-kin who swear their
loyalty to their God-King Vulcan. On most occasions, outlanders dare
not tread in the sacred sands, for fear of finding lord Vulcan's wrath.
There are times though, when other "lesser races" believe that they can
stand tall against Vulcan. They are sorely mistaken.

Defending the deserts of Vulcan is the elite guard known as the Prefecture,
a conclave of Fire Giants gathered from the highest ranks of all Vulcanian
professions, combined with an outstanding army of loyal slaves. The
Prefecture not only serves as a defense force against invading peoples,
but also serves as Vulcan's secret police, going out into the world to
gather slaves, information, and riches. Only the most brave (or foolish)
of adventurers would dare stend in the Prefecture's way.

The Vulcanian Prefecture was founded in 68AH by Penzsovar Katona who
served for twenty years as the Prefecture's reigning Praetor. After
his years of service to Vulcan, the office of Praetor was handed to the
devout monk Arklyn, creator of the Arkanon style of martial arts whom
commands the Prefecture's forces to this very day.

Fire Giants wishing to join the Prefecture need merely speak to one
of its officers or send message to the Praetor Arklyn himself. All
Fire Giants will be granted privlidged access to Prefecture magics and
equipment. Any non-fire giant race wishing to submit to the will of
the True God Vulcan should seek out the nearest uniformed Prefecture
Officer and grovel before his might so that he may recognize you for
a servant, and not an ant.
