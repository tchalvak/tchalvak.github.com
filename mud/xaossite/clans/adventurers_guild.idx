A cluster of rifts open up in what was then the center of Visari.  Demonic,
horrible beasts and powerful undead poured out, killing whatever they came
across and even destroying structures that stood in their way.  Those who
could oppose them did so, fighting back against the beasts, deafeating them
or driving them back into the rifts.  The surviving members of the Visarian
council quickly came together and appointed those that they felt would best
serve as protectors against the beings from the portals to form a guild to
keep the creatures in check.  Thus began the Adventurer's Guild.  The guild
has grown so adept at this that the planes through the rifts are beginning
to actually be explored. Now the Guild is mainly there to keep watch over
those that go into the portals and obliterate whatever attempts to go out.  
One of the founders of the Guild, the former gladiator Lydia, now leads it.
