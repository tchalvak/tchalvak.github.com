                   The Merchant's Guild

   The heart of any good business model is having a well structured
and fundamentally sound method of profit aquisition.  The Merchant's
Guild takes this mission statement seriously and seeks to further its
expanse into the known world as just that, the perfect business model
and accepts no other alternative.

   The truest measure of one's success is the fortune amassed and the
legacy which follows it.  Respect is commanded by those who take hold
of thier destiny and bring about the means to achieve any goal.  The
Merchant's Guild has a clear goal:  Total economic domination.  Gold
is our means to accomplish our goals.  The Merchant's Guild thrives
upon commerse in all forms and locations.  We setup shop anywhere
that a profit can be successfully made.  Our funds are massive and
our reach is limitless.  We are the very core of wealth and stable
growth.

   The major points of our business model are as follows:

Profit       - Never partake in an activity that does not directly
               supply yourself and more importantly the Merchant's
               Guild with capital gains and/or assets.

Loyalty      - What use is security when the forces that perform the
               tasks are disloyal.  Guild members shall not involve
               themselves in activities that compromise the security
               and well being of the Merchant's Guild.

Partnerships - A friendship without profit is an unhealthy one.  There
               must be a synergy of gain within all partnerships
               established by merchants of the Merchant's Guild.  It
               is very important to uphold this, else the rot of a
               profitless environment may set in.  Ultimately a
               partner who cannot endevour to compensate for your
               interactions is undesirable and must be salted, as
               one does to any other form of leech.

   The Merchant's Guild is always looking for expansions and new
markets and if you possess a keen business sense and the drive to
deliver sensation returns then the Merchant's Guild invites you to
send your resume to 'merchantguild' where a member of the living
