It is rumored that there is a hidden labyrinth of caves entrenched deep
in the swamps that is the location of a dark god who watches over strange
cannibalistic lizard-men. It is further said that these creatures have
challenged the might of the Horde with sly raids upon Gobold, leaving only
slaughtered, half-eaten corpses behind.
