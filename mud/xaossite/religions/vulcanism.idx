In the harsh deserts of the southern country known as Khallas there lies a
race of proud people known as the Fire Giants. These reclusive people
worship a divine entity they believe created their species thousands od
millennia ago, a deity known as Vulcan. Though Vulcan has no other followers
except for his 'children', that is all he requires. Vulcan does not lust for
power as so many other gods do, he would much rather live to see his people
grow and mature into what he has hopes for them to become.   Vulcan is also
a staunch proponent for slavery, as he believes a strict caste system in
society helps bring a foundation of order to the lands. As such, the great
pyramid of Vulcan houses an immense fighting arena where slaves and free
citizens go to battle before crowds in the thouands.

<b>Mythos:</b> Followers of Vulcan follow in the footsteps of their lord
and are amazing creators. Most followers of Vulcan are amazing craftsmen
in many categories, be it jewelers or blacksmiths. Vulcan promotes
his followers to live life to its fullest, and to experience every
sensation at least once. Vulcanian priests are also very pleased
with combat, as Vulcan has promoted them to become great warriors
in the aren. Priests are also charged with the duties of creating
funeral pyres for dead followers of Vulcan to be burned upon.
The ceremonies are known to last well over seven hours.
 
<b>Holy Days:</b> The day of fire in the month of heat is known by
the Vulcanians as the day their race was spawned from the sands of the desert.
On this day, the city of Vulcan explodes into a huge festival of dancing,
music, and battle. The arena becomes open to all citizens, and anyone who
wishes to try their hand at a battle may. Also, at the Axial plaza of
the Pyramid, a huge wooden statue of Vulcan is constructed then set
ablaze as a symbol of honor to their burning god. Fire Giants outside
of Vulcanian during this time seek out the nearest arena o do battle
to honor Vulcan with tie shedding of their own blood, as he bled on the
sands to create the fire giants.
