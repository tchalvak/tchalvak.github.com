In the harsh jungles far south of the human lands, the race of vondoni 
dogmen have thrived for long generations. Throughout this time of deep 
isolation, the Vondoni have created a religion that devotes itself to the
will and benefit of the tribe. As such, only a vondoni may be a member of
the tribe, and any vondoni outcast from the tribe cannot rejoin the tribe. 
A tale was once told of a mageling transmuter who changed his race to
vondoni, this transmuter did then wander into the tribes and was accepted. 
The tribes learned from this mistake. The decietful transmuter then stole
from the Tribe and was outcast. Because of this, the Tribe has become
distrustful of mages, especially transmuters, a member of the Tribe who sees
a transmuter change into the form of a vondoni, will never associate
themselves with that person.  The religion of Varseg has always centered
around the tribe. Varseg is a religion speaking of the blood, and the hunt
necessary for tribal survival. The tribe is all important in the eyes of the
Vondoni.
