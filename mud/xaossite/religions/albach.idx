Within the minds of all creatures large and small, there remains one
constant...  fear.  Even the most primal of creatures can be instilled by
fear, from the mightiest dragon, to the weakest animal.  One such entity,
feeds off of the fear and evil intent of others, a dark god known as Albach
Ra.  His origins are clouded in a veil of secrecy, but his appearance in
Terra has only been recorded as of late.  Known as a master manipulator,
Albach is a vile and powerful demon whose only goal is the domination of
Terra thorugh the actions of his minions and underlings.  Only the most
sinister and cruel of beings can even stomach the presence of the Undying
Nightmare God.  
 
<b>UnHoly symbol:</b> A red crescent moon on a black field
 
<b>Spheres of Influence:</b> Nightmares, Manipulation, Shadows, Evil, Undead
 
<b>Alignment:</b> Neutral Evil
 
<b>Worshipper's Alignment:</b> Any Evil
 
<b>Mythos:</b> Followers of Albach Ra are a plague of the world. Their
dark and dispicable actions are the things of true nightmares. Albach's
followers are commonly wizards and priests, though he sometimes
employs the aid of assassins and warriors to protect his spellcasters.
It is widely known that Albach's followers are powerful manipulators
of being's will and can charm nearly any entity into doing their
will with their sharp tongues. If a traveler is ever wounded or disabled
and encounters a follower of Albach, expect a slow and painful death,
or an offer of healing for an owing of a favor. Death is usually
a more reasonable option.
 
<b>UnHoly Days:</b> The two months of Moon followed by Shadow are
believed to be months of power for Albach's followers as it is believed
that their powers are increased during this time. It is also during
these months when the rare red crescent partial eclipse takes place
once every year. The sun is partially eclipsed by Terra's moon creating
a blazing red crescent in the sky. During this day, followers of
Albach commit hundreds of acts of murder, sacrifice, and ritual
magic in hopes to invoke favor to their undying god and to be granted
his powers of fear and manipulation for another year. It is unknown
if such acxts are required by Albach, or are mere delusions of
his dark clerics desires.
