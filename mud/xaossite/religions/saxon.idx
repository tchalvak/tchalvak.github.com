Of the proud people of the Storm Giants, there is only one god who watches
over them, a god known as Crom.  The religion of Saxon is believed to have
appeared soon after the Storm Giant's imprisonment after the incident that
nearly destroyed the city of Static.  Crom's faith is a kind one, ruled by
his even hand.  Though those that cross Crom's faith will certainly find
that he is not the god of storms for no reason.  Though Crom is a kind god,
he has a deep hunger for revenge against those who would enslave his people,
and an ever greater thirst for justice.

of Crom otfen find great relaxation and shelter even in the most
violent of storms, and it is believed that no storm will ever strike
a faithful follower of crom with injury. 
 
<b>Holy Days:</b> The day of Storms in the Month of Hope is often revered
by followers of Crom as the time of which they are closest to Crom's
divine essence. During this holy-day, followers and priests of Crom

to speak, for they must be ever vigilant to listen to Crom's words
bellowing in storms from the heavens.
