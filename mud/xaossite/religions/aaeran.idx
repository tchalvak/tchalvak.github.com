Aaeran is the Goddess Queen of the Drow, the immortal beauty who protects
and adores her followers.  Her favourites are those most like her, beautiful
and cunning.  Her view upon men is that of pawns in the master game to be
played by her daughters, and therefore refuses men the privilege of working
as her primary representatives in the priestesshood.  Aaeran rarely, if ever
even acknoweldges her followers unless they do something that deserves her
appearance, and she does not look favourably upon those who suggest that she
appear.  It is best that all of her followers keep favour with her, as she
is easily angered if she is not fed the blood she craves.  
 
<b>Worshippers Alignment:</b> Any evil, Any Neutral, Drow
 
<b>Religion Alignment:</b> Lawful Evil
 
<b>Holy Symbol:</b> A woman's eye with tears of blood.

<b>Acts of Favour:</b>  The Mistress of the Underground craves the blood of her

gained when the corpses are sacrificed on her altars, with the blood being
allowed to drip down the stairs of her temples so that all may see.
