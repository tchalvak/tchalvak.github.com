Deep within the valley of the giants, a philosophy has been created upon the
foundation of balance and equality.  The hill giants in their wisdom have 
brought forth this philosophy, which they simply call "The Balance".  The 
Balance has no one deity, but is merely a collection of ideals and beliefs, 
where power is drawn from sheer faith.  Though the religion is small in its 
following now, it may soon expand to other lands, as it has a similar appeal to 
that of Xaos.  
 
<b>Holy Symbol:</b> The Scales of Balance

<b>Spheres of Influence:</b> War, Peace, Elements 
 
<b>Mythos:</b> The scales of Balance are forever in jeopardy. Good pulls on one 
side and Evil from the other. We must balance these forces, for if the scales 
were to tip too far to one side or the other, Chaos would rule over all. The 
opposite, the bleak, unswinging rule of Order, would wilt life's vitality. We 
bolster both change and stability to sustain them against their opposite. It is 
through this mechanism that life is sustained, by achieving the Balance between 
Chaos and Order.
We are the judges and the protectors of Fate.
We fight the destruction of Chaos, keep the battles of mortals in check to guard 
against the corruption of this plane by Chaos. We also counter the apathy of 
Order, oppression and control must be warded against gaining too much influence.
We defend all and combat those who would bring the many under one rule.
Each follower has their role to fulfill in the grand scheme. Our final goal will
be to move into the planes of chaos and bring Order from damage they have done. 
So too shall we loose Chaos into the dull and lifeless planes of order.
Good and Evil are inconsequential to life, they are contrived and artifical and
therefore are to be ignored. We weigh power, for too much power is a detriment
and must be returned back to balance.
 
<b>Duties:</b> 
Each follower shall abide by the following duties. 
Hold no control over another.
Judge and execute those who hold power over others.
If power is not equal, balance power with counter-acting power.
 
<b>Holy Days:</b> Any day or time that a follower wishes, they may honor the day to 
Balance. Sacrifices of one holy symbol of all religions, and an item from each 
powerful clan, guild, or army. To do this is the Rite of Balance. It must be 
performed in the presence of the Voice or Ceriloch.

<b>Patron:</b>  the Balance
<b>Castes:</b>  follower  champion
