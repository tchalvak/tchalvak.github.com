        This brief ten-question quiz concerns your character's alignment.&nbsp; 
        The referee has spent a great deal of time considering the various alignments, 
        just exactly how they think, and since your adherence to your alignment 
        can affect your adventure grade, which in turn can cost you training money, 
        it behooves you to consider carefully what your character's alignment 
        is, what he believes, and how that will at times affect his conduct. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The method is simple.&nbsp; Each of the questions 
        is followed by four answers.&nbsp; You must read the answers, and rank 
        them from the one which is most like your character (4) to the one which 
        is least like your character (1).&nbsp; You must so rank each answer for 
        each question; there can be no answers not ranked, and no tied answers.&nbsp; 
        One answer to each question must be ranked 4 (the most), another 3, another 
        2, and the remaining answer, the one least like your character, 1.&nbsp; 
        The first five questions have the beginning of a sentence, followed by 
        four possible completions.&nbsp; The last five questions have four statements 
        related to an issue.&nbsp; In each case, rank the choices from most to 
        least like your character, with 4 being most. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scoring and explanations follow.&nbsp; Please do not 
        look at them until you have answered all ten questions and are satisfied 
        with your answers.&nbsp; As far as how to answer, remember two things.&nbsp; 
        First, this is to be answered from the perspective of your character, 
        and not from your own view.&nbsp; You may disagree strongly with your 
        character, or believe he is a little one-sided on some issues; but it 
        is the character's answer to the question which matters.&nbsp; Second, 
        alignment is not a character trait or a byword or a club.&nbsp; Alignment 
        is a belief system, a core value in a theological philosophy of life.&nbsp; 
        This is, at the heart, what your character believes the world is or should 
        be like.&nbsp; It affects his life, because he will try to be what he 
        thinks the world should be.&nbsp; But you must remember that the character's 
        alignment is something he believes in, and that it therefore has an articulable 
        content which distinguishes it from any other alignment at the theoretical 
        level.&nbsp; Even when your character agrees with a character of a different 
        alignment as to the correct course of action, it is usually for a different 
        reason.&nbsp; These questions attempt to get to those reasons.
      <p><font color="#66FF00">Warning:</font> You can still complete this quiz 
        by hand, however, the on-line form below does not detect neutral characters 
        very well.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have probably guessed, each of the questions 
        approaches a different issue, and each of the answers relates to a different 
        alignment.&nbsp; Eight of the ten questions distinguish law, chaos, good, 
        and evil; the remaining two questions force the character to choose between 
        corner alignments, making him prefer one thing over another.&nbsp; It 
        is not expected that any character will always choose the anwer for his 
        own alignment first; however, overall there should be more answers under 
        your chosen alignment than under the others.&nbsp; For neutrals, there 
        should be a visible balance, in which answers cross all alignment choices 
        <br>
        fairly easily. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For quick and easy scoring, this chart has been set 
        up with the question numbers, and the answers, by letter, under appropriate 
        columns.&nbsp; Compare your answers to the chart, copying the number you 
        wrote next to the same letter here as there.&nbsp; For questions 3 and 
        7, there are two lines, and your answer should appear once in each.&nbsp; 
        Once you have copied your answers into the appropriate column, sum the 
        columns. <br>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, you should compare your Law and Chaos 
        scores, and subtract the smaller from the larger; then do the same with 
        your Good and Evil Scores.&nbsp; This gives your tendency toward whichever 
        of the scores is larger.&nbsp; For example, if your scores are Law 44, 
        Chaos 21, Good 35, and Evil 20, then you are 44-21=23 points toward Lawful, 
        and 35-20=15 points toward good.&nbsp; Themaximum possible score in any 
        column is 46, and the minimum is 14; therefore the greatest possible difference 
        is 30.&nbsp; The greatestpossible difference in both dimensions at once 
        is 22.&nbsp; Differences of up to about 8 are considered nearly neutral, 
        with slight or strong tendencies in one direction.&nbsp; Differences above 
        10 are clearly in the alignment specified.&nbsp; Side alignment characters 
        should obviously be stronger in the chosen alignment, but may have a little 
        more leeway on what constitutes neutral, perhaps as high as 10 representing 
        strong tendencies toward one side.&nbsp; True neutrals should have at 
        least one dimension clearly under 8, and neither over ten.&nbsp; The same 
        maximum scores which could represent a side alignment with a strong tendency 
        from the neutral can also be viewed as a corner alignment with a strong 
        tendency to favor one axis.&nbsp; However, the player will be more comfortable 
        with a character whose alignment scores are clearly within the parameters 
        of the chosen alignment.

        the greater number if the difference is not zero:

      &nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp; 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, by now you are arguing with my answers.&nbsp; 
        Here, then, question by question, is the logic of each answer. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font color="#FF9900">Question 1</font></b> gets 
        to the <i>motive of the character</i>.&nbsp; Good characters are always 
        looking to make the world a better place; therefore, answer B, rescuing 
        the weak and helping the helpless, is the good answer.&nbsp; Lawfuls see 
        the world as necessarily being structured, and the unstructured elements 
        as breaking that down.&nbsp; A quest into the unknown has the primary 
        purpose of taming it; therefore, answer A, putting things right, is a 
        lawful response.&nbsp; Answer D, acquiring wealth and power, is definitive 
        of the evil alignment; evils believe that such is theirs by right.&nbsp; 
        As to the chaotic, there can be little reason for such an adventure except 
        the adventure itself, and so answer C, enjoying the thrill of the dangers, 
        is the best choice. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font color="#FF9900">Question 2</font></b> looks 
        at character, belief, and personality by considering an <i>alternative 
        career path</i>.&nbsp; The good character will want to do something to 
        help others, especially the poor, so an herbalist, answer C, is the best 
        choice.&nbsp; Evil characters will still want to claim what is theirs, 
        and so answer B, bandit, comes closest.&nbsp; A man-at-arms is clearly 
        involved in a defined position in an authority structure; he knows whence 
        his orders come, what is expected of him, and who he commands.&nbsp; All 
        this, answer A, will appeal to the lawful character.&nbsp; As to the chaotic 
        character, he has no need of any of those things, but wants to live his 
        own life.&nbsp; Being a hermit, answer D, is the easiest way to escape 
        from the structures of society. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font color="#FF9900">Question 3</font></b> is 
        the first of the corner alignment questions.&nbsp; Each of the four <i>heroes</i> 
        defines (at least in the popular conception) one of the four combinations.&nbsp; 
        Robin Hood is definitively the chaotic good hero, opposing all that is 
        law and structure because it oppresses the people, and taking the profit 
        he gains for his opposition and giving it to them.&nbsp; Answer A thus 
        credits chaos and good.&nbsp; King Arthur, on the other hand, built one 
        of the finest orderly systems, complete with law and enforcement, command 
        and authority, to bring down the notion that might makes right and establish 
        a good society.&nbsp; He, answer B, combines good with law.&nbsp; Attilla 
        the Hun is most noted for tearing down structures in Europe and Asia.&nbsp; 
        Although he maintained a highly disciplined army for the purpose, he is 
        seen as a raider who destroys entire countries to line his own pocket.&nbsp; 
        This is very close to the heart of chaotic evil, and falls as answer C.&nbsp; 
        When it comes to moving within the dark side, Darth Vader shows us clearly 
        how one can be entirely out for one's self while being completely obedient 
        to a master and strictly part of a chain of command.&nbsp; His entire 
        aspect combines the disciplines of law with the values of evil, and so 
        answer D is the lawful evil choice. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font color="#FF9900">Question 4</font></b> restates 
        question one, using names instead of descriptions, to reach the motive 
        of the character in a more poetic way.&nbsp; The soldier, answer A, is 
        the one in the authority structure, the lawful.&nbsp; Heroes are those 
        who rescue others for the sake of the rescued; answer B thus is the good 
        answer.&nbsp; Answer D, the rogue, describes those trying to better themselves 
        at the expense of others, frequently by deception, and is the evil selection.&nbsp; 
        The adventurer is the one who does this because it is there to be done; 
        the is the chaotic, having no better reason to explore than that he may. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font color="#FF9900">Question 5</font></b> asks 
        what should happen when the adventure is over.&nbsp; The first answer, 
        wipe out the party and abscond with the money, is clearly the evil answer; 
        many an evil party has passed out of existence because one of them understood 
        answer A as the correct choice.&nbsp; Answer B places the planning of 
        another venture in the hands of those in charge, the lawful decision.&nbsp; 
        Answer C points up that good characters are always seeking to do good; 
        adventuring is generally a way of gaining the means to do so, and the 
        doing good continues between the adventures.&nbsp; Answer D breaks the 
        party up.&nbsp; To the chaotic, the party is a necessary evil which exists 
        for the purpose of the adventure; when the adventure is over, the party 
        no longer really exists except as a group of friends who might adventure 
        again someday.&nbsp; While the lawful thinks of the party as ongoing, 
        an authority structure which continues, the chaotic rejects this notion, 
        and opposes any idea that party rules apply to party members when the 
        necessity of a present danger does not exist. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue in <b><font color="#FF9900">question 6</font></b> 
        is <i>structure and planning</i>.&nbsp; This is a law/chaos issue, of 
        no real interest to good and evil.&nbsp; The lawful character will choose 
        answer A, because he believes in planning as the best means to achieve 
        goals.&nbsp; The chaotic character will reject answer A, preferring answer 
        B, maintaining flexibility as a way to seize opportunities.&nbsp; The 
        good character would be less interested in these aspects, but would tend 
        toward a balance in which there is enough flexibility to help others, 
        however strictly the plan is formed, thus choosing answer C.&nbsp; Finally, 
        when it comes to planning, the evil character will always keep in mind 
        his maxim, look out for yourself first, answer D. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <b><font color="#FF9900">question 7</font></b>, 
        the other corner alignment question, the issue is the <i>nature of government</i>.&nbsp; 
        Answer A describes a belief in which government is ultimately minimized, 
        making it possible for people to be freed from the oppressions of law 
        to just be good to each other the way they would be were it not for the 
        pressures on them to conform.&nbsp; This is a chaotic good belief, and 
        so credits both chaos and good.&nbsp; The lawful good opposes this view, 
        maintaining answer B, that crime must be controlled (by law) in order 
        for everyone to prosper.&nbsp; The lawful evil character does not care 
        about the rest of society, but recognizes in a strong government the opportunity 
        for him to move into the position he deserves, and so chooses answer C, 
        expecting that he is one of those best people.&nbsp; Answer D is the song 
        of the chaotic evil, that the government is trying to keep us in our place, 
        refusing to allow us to do what we want. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font color="#FF9900">Question 8</font></b> is 
        the <i>slavery</i> issue.&nbsp; This is difficult to understand in our 
        society.&nbsp; Slavery itself is not a good/evil issue, but a law/chaos 
        issue.&nbsp; It is possible to perceive slavery as a force for good, providing 
        a home for those who would not otherwise have it by employing their services 
        to produce for society at large.&nbsp; In a society in which slavery is 
        legal, lawfuls will not oppose it on lawful grounds, because on lawful 
        grounds it is, as answer C suggests, a reasonable solution to certain 
        economic problems.&nbsp; Conversely, chaotic characters will always oppose 
        enslavement of any creature in principle, whether or not it's legal, and 
        will thus choose answer A.&nbsp; To the good character, the issue is not 
        slavery itself but the treatment of slaves by masters; if slaves are generally 
        well treated, there is not much about which to complain.&nbsp; However, 
        answer B suggests that to the good the inherent flaw in slavery is its 
        openness to abuse by the strong against the weak.&nbsp; As to the evil 
        character, he believes that society should permit him to have what he 
        wants.&nbsp; Although slavery is not a good/evil issue, he sees himself 
        as worthy of being a master if slavery is to exist, and to be treated 
        with deference even where it does not, answer D. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The relationship of the individual to the <i>civil 
        law</i> is the next issue, in <b><font color="#FF9900">question 9</font></b>.&nbsp; 
        Of course, the lawful believes that law is essential to society, answer 
        C.&nbsp; The chaotic follows that great American maxim that less is more, 
        answer A, rejecting the need for law.&nbsp; To the good character, it 
        is a non-issue.&nbsp; If you are good, says answer B, the law will ignore 
        you.&nbsp; As to answer D, the evil character also sees it as a non-issue.&nbsp; 
        Law or no law, you can make whatever is there work for you.&nbsp; It is 
        your advantage that counts. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally <b><font color="#FF9900">question 10</font></b> 
        asks us about our unwritten <i>duty</i>.&nbsp; The good character sees, 
        with answer A, that we are all connected, and have a duty to help everyone 
        else.&nbsp; The lawful character, taking answer B, thinks of duty more 
        in terms of the authority which must be obeyed.&nbsp; A duty to himself, 
        answer C, is the evil character's way of thinking:&nbsp; put yourself 
        first.&nbsp; As to the chaotic, perhaps there are some duties to freedom 
        and liberty, or perhaps some have duties to masters they have chosen to 
        obey, or duties to philanthropies and charities to which they are pledged, 
        but in the final analysis you cannot tell anyone that everyone has any 
        specific single duty.&nbsp; It depends on who you are.&nbsp; Thus answer 
        D expresses the chaotic view. 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this quiz has helped you understand who your 
        character is and what his alignment really means to him.&nbsp; If you 
        don't like the answer you got, perhaps you should either reconsider your 
        character's motivations and actions, or talk to the DM about a non-penalized 
        alignment change based on a misunderstanding of what your selected alignment 
        really meant. </td>
