Goblins are a small race, the smallest of the humanoids, and they make up
for it with malicious evil acts and pack killing. They tend to live in
swamps and get along perfectly with trolls. They don't have quite the mental
mastery for becoming mages but the other professions suit their needs just
fine. They also have a venomous spit that the most acute goblins can not
only blind someone with a spit, but release a venom at the same time.
