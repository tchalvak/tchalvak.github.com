Arguably the oldest race, they have a long and colourful history that has
spawned many myths and legends. Deeply rooted within their own culture elves
rarely associate with the other demi-humans and only visit the other pockets
of the land in search of sport or adventure.  All elves possess and innate
mastery of magic, while not always evident through spells they are capable
of harnessing the magic around them better then most other races.   Some
argue that an elven warrior can out-do a human mage in a duel of spells.
Most people however know better then to focus on that single power, as it is
only one of the many talents the elves hold.  Because of their secretive
nature, elves have adapted to being unseen and unheard.   Also elves are
noted for being resilient to their own natural attractiveness a swell as
most others, even magical means of controlling suffer problems when an elf
is the target.  The physical appearance of elves is very similar to humans,
although slightly taller, they possess a lighter frame and are generally
more agile. Lastly, never expect to have an elf to a disadvantage in the
dark corners of the realm, fore they share keen night vision with dwarves.
