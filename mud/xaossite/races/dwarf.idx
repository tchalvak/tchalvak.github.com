DWARF

The oldest of the dwarves can tell you of the days before the great wars. 
They have an unmatched love for creation that shows through the massive
amounts of work that go into each dwarven building or weapon. Dwarves are
also known for foul tempers and an uncontrolled burst of emotion, to enrage
a dwarf is a stiff gamble indeed.  While stocky and lacking dexterity, they
make up for it with incredible strength and stamina. But any dwarf will tell
you that they pride not pure force but rather knowledge, which no dwarf is
without thanks to years of tutorage from the older generations. Being
underground most of their lives gifts dwarves with the abilities to see into
the darkest tunnels clearly for several hundred feet.  Dwarves don't
associate much with the outside world, tending to keep within the complex
network of caverns they have created over the centuries. They deal with any
intrusion harshly unless good cause is given. Sworn enemies of the tribes
and drow, dwarves often fight to the death to keep the hoards from invading.
