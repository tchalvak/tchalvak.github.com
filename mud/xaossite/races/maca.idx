The maca are a short resembling insects, and are only about two feet tall.  
Created by the fae they serve the sprites and pixies in the Lost Woods as
personal servants and forest keepers.  The maca have three different skin
tones which are light green, dark green, and light brown. Their eyes can be
any hue and look surprisingly human. They have a mouth like a grasshopper
but their mandibles are small therefore they are unable to bite.  Their legs
are short and stubby to support the weight of their upper body which juts
forward and are quite thick to support the four strong arms they have.  
Though they are not particularly strong in any specific respect, they have
the intelligence of the fae to guide them. They have been known to adventure
for many reasons: the call of the Goddess whom they adore, the sprites or pixies
calling on them, or simply the strange wanderlust that inflicts a small
number of their kind.  To suit the needs of the fae people, the maca have
become divided and serve the different sides of the fae accordingly.   All
good maca train as warriors and will follow pixies willingly and loyally
once their trust has been earned, evil maca will train as thieves and help
the sprites in their mischief to no end.
