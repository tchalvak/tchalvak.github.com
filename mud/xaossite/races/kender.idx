Kender are a race of endless curiosity, unmatchable bravery and extreme
innocence. Descendants of an elven tribe long before the first of the great
cities was even thought of, the Kender have evolved as a culture full of
colourful humour and peacefulness. It's almost unheard of that any Kender
would knowingly act in an aggressive manner unless it was to defend a fellow
Kender or dear friend.  Smaller then your average adventurer, they stand at
about a human's waist, with this smaller size comes the usual agility and
dexterity, however the Kender have one aspect of quickness which the world
will forever watch them for. Kender are the master thieves, however they'll
be the last to know.  Compulsive curiosity curses them with an uncanny
ability of palming any object in sight. While they are do this out of good
intentions alone, many of the land's shop keeps fail to understand or
tolerate it and thus a Kender is branded a thief, regardless of their
training or goals.
