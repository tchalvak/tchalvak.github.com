Yetis are large humanoids, covered entirely with shaggy fur that grows
throughout their life into graceful long strands of whisping elegance. They
are not particularly bright but one standing thought prevails their
misfortunate intelligence, their value of good. Primarily a race of
fundamentalist values, they are warriors only, the rare cleric appears from
the midst but is quickly ushered into roles of domestic guidance and tribal
well being.  Rumours of their besting giants at games of strength are mostly
true, undoubtedly a result of the mountain climate. They have made one very
deep bond with a fellow mountain dwelling race.  Chinchillas are well known
for their fur, it is kept this way by the Yeti who care for them deeply, to
hurt a Chinchilla is to wound the Yeti, which by custom means the summary
execution of the evil's life.  Living high over the Desert of Vulcan on a
bridge of mountains that holds the burning sands from further expansion into
the grassy plains to the north live these gentle creatures. They eat fruits
that grow from trees that have undeniably magical properties, giving the
beasts extraordinary sources of nourishment and quantities that let their
tribe grow as it wishes.  While settled into the mountain range comfortably,
they encourage their youth upon reaching adulthood to explore the world,
seeking friendships and adventure, but above all to seek out evil and meet
it in battle.  Yetis mainly worship the goddess Shanta, her wisdom has been
enlightening to their tribe since discovering her ways. Sometimes for brief
periods of times a yeti will look to another god to experience its ways, but
often they will revert to the simple wisdoms upon returning home next. The
birth of the Yeti as a species is a act of Shanta's way.  Her sadness from
the spread of evil in the lands prompted a glimpse of hope for her vision.  
The peaks over her hated adversary Vulcan's own burning sand trap met all
expectations.  Their philosophies are renowned to be a code of conduct, not
strict in any sense but the lines that are drawn do not get crossed.  
Corruption to a Yeti is the worst form of evil and undead are the most
repulsive to their kind.  Few Yetis have ever been taken alive to the Vulcan
arenas, and it has been rumoured that Yetis attack Fire giants on sight
because of their evil god.  Vulcan's in turn have put a high price on
healthy yeti, considering them chic pets.  The Yeti's life is a long one,
filled with stories to tell the generations which follow and spread the
wisdom of experience. They travel as strong and simple-minded bastions of
good, to bring Shanta's dream of paradise to life, no matter the cost.
