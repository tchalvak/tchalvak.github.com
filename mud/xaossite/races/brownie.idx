Brownies are the same size as the sprites and the pixies, and the only
characteristic they lack is the natural ability to fly.  Their skin,
hair and eyes are often varying shades of brown, which is best for 
them to camouflage themselves within the forest, though it is not
uncommon to have yellow or green eyes or varying natural shades of
hair.  They also lack the characteristic trail of faerie dust that
their winged cousins leave, however they have the innate knowledge of
how to produce and use the dust and powders best in battle.  There
are very rarely any brownies who choose to be voices of the Goddess,
and for that reason it is likely that there will be representation
of the pixies and the sprites within their holy shrines.
 
As with their winged friends, the brownies are resistant towards
magic.  In the respect of education, the brownies tend to leave the
more intelligent positions to their winged cousins and make excellent
warriors or thieves.  The most esteemed position within the brownie
rank goes to the ranger, who has the ability to tame the woodland
creatures best and bring them back to the outpost to provide mounts,
winged and otherwise, to the rest of the community.  Other, less
industrious brownies choose other paths as warriors or thieves, all
in the name of protection of the lost woods and its inhabitants.
Though all brownies possess the basic knowledge of the preparation of
different powders and other magical concoctions, brownie thieves are
revered for their talents in the usage of powders and bombs in battle.
