The orcs were not pleased with the finding of humans treading on tribal soil
and when the humans set up townships and it became evident that they just
weren't going to go away, the orcs lead mass attacks against the villages
and slaughtered the settlers without pity. Among the most brutal of those
raids many of the human women were left bearing the children of these orcish
raiders, and so began the race of half orcs.  Like a constant reminder of
the humanoid's wrath, the half orcs are not generally accepted into human
society. Most find life to be very lonely and any chance to make an ally
they'll take, regardless of the nature.  The orcs on the other hand show no
mercy at the capture of a half orc.  They believe there is absolutely no
place for the 'disgusting' creatures.
