Of all the giant kin, none are more prideful of their stature than the
chosen of Vulcan, the Fire Giants. A Fire Giant stands an average of twenty
feet tall and weigh upwards of 14 hundred pounds. Their skin is most often
an ash grey, and their race was created by Vulcan to be naturally resistant
to heat and flames, perhaps the one thing that allows them to survive in the
desert.  A Fire Giant's hair color ranges from a deep crimson or vermilion
to pale shades of yellow-gold, all of the colors of Vulcan's own fire. A
Fire Giant's eyes hold the same ranges of hue as their hair, though it is
not uncommon for each to be different colors. Fire giants usually dress in
pure white cloth, winding huge swaths of it around themselves in a
complicated fashion hat has become almost ritual among their people.  Their
heads are always uncovered in the desert, exposed to Vulcan's might, though,
of course, the heat does not affect them. They adorn themselves with all
manner of precious metals and gems, basking in Vulcan's favor, and, strange
considering their strength, rely upon their ranks of slaves to perform much
of their labor for them.
