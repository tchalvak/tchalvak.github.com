	http://federaltaxreturn.com/<br>Just something to remember, of course.  Just had my meeting of the Bio Group Today, and it's still, like usual, a hectic experience.  Doing things in groups has it's pros and cons, but it usually takes more work for the pros to yeild good results than for the cons to do so.  Luckily I'm not that bad at communication with others and various related skills.  I think.<br>Blah.<br>

	Excerpt from a song that I remember singing as a child:<br><p>It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring, he went to bed and bumped his head and couldn't get up in the morning.  <br><p>I heard someone singing it who was probably older than I am.  It amused me.<br><p>*ggkk*<br>bing<br>

	<a href="http://sweetfancymoses.com/amati_kon0-1.htm">http://sweetfancymoses.com/amati_kon0-1.htm</a><br><p>The beginnings of a very interesting story.  Well, I'm going to update the site with a few odds and ends shortly.  Of course, as always, the problem that the place that I eat at is continuously closing at the wrong time points to the fact that I'll have to go soon to get my nutritional requirements for the moment.  Soon being within ten minutes.  We'll see whether I can manage to tear myself away.<br>I've got somethings going.  Let's see... No, Perhaps I lied.  I thought that there were some things that I had been doing, but I must have been mistaken.  It happens rather frequently.  Ah, yes, I remember now.  *sigh*  I've a number of chemistry laboratory things to manage, as well as some homework for chemistry proper as well.<br>But those were not what I was speaking of, as I was certain that there were much more interesting things that I had in mind.  Ah, yes, creation of a mud and such.  I'll explain sometime, perhaps.<br>

	http://www.nuklearpower.com/comic/index.html<br><p>I've lost it.  No, not in that way, that's always been the case.<br>I've misplaced my notebook of meanderings, something that should not be able to be possible.  I will have to rectify as soon as possible, cannot exist without it.  Of course, it's hard to find when I'm miles away at home and it was last seen in the area of my dorm room, but I'll just have to be patient.  It would be a telling blow for it to be gone.<br><p>I think that I may revitalize and resurrect the log, we'll see, won't we.  I do want to continue my quest to complete my site in it's totality...  Another thing that may just turn out to be an ideal and nothing more.<br><p>No matter.  <br>Bookums.<br><p>-Ro<br><br>
