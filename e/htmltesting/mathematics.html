<h1>Sometimes you can use math in real life.</h1>
<pre>
       Why do females have to cause so much trouble? 
       Given the fact that: 
    Having a girlfriend takes both money and time. [Female = Money * Time] 
       And keeping in mind a few old adages: 
    "Time is money." Time = Money 
    "Money is the root of all evil." Money = (square root of) Evil 

    One gets this proof. 
       Female = Money * Time 
       and Time = Money 
       lead to Female = Money * Money [Money squared] 
       and Money = (square root of) Evil 
       lead to Female = (square root of) Evil * (square root of) Evil 
       leads to Female = (square root of) Evil (squared) 
       leads to Female = Evil. 
       There you have it, mathmatical proof that Females are Evil.
