Well, again, I have no time on Wednesdays because of Classes, though thursdays from 4-6 are free.  However, we really don't need to meet before doing this case study, necessarily.  We might as well just ask our questions over email and such things, unless all of you feel it necessary that we meet to brainstorm beforehand.

Anyway, to start off the Case study:

Definition of problem:
The girl would seem, from the lack of pus, to have a missing part in her immune defenses which makes her more succeptible to infection.
Possibilities:
From the information, most specifically the lack of pus, and going through the parts of the immunodefense system, she would appear to be missing some part of the immunity provided by one of the following:
Phagocytic White blood cells, Antimicrobial proteins, and Lymphocytes.  Since pus is simply the accumulation at a point of infection of body phagocytes and only to a much lesser extent invading microbes, the lack of pus points to at minimum a lack of phagocytes, specifically neutrophils and macrophages, though there may exist other issues as well.

Therefore, we need two sets of hypotheses:
A: In what area[s] is she deficient;
Hypotheses:
Neutrophil Deficiency
Secondary and less likely possibility of deficiency of type C3 immuno-protein.

B: What is the underlying cause of this deficiency;
Hypotheses:
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

Under the premise of Leukemia, resulting questions:

Do the results of a full blood count show decreased prevelency of neutrophils and/or all white blood cells?
If so, does a bone marrow examination show any accumulation of myeloblasts?
[Unlikely] If so, does the bone marrow examination show any reduction in normal blood forming cells?
