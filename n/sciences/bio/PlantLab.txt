Paragraph on their germination:

In 5 dfays, the seed of about a mm or two becomes a plant around 2 cm high, each stalk splitting into two seperate leaves.  (So it's a dicot).  EAch leaf has two lobes.  The stem has a very small protrusion inbetween the two leaf stalks that would seem to be the original tip of the seedling.
A few of the seedlings are still in the process of splitting their seed case and throwing down the main root (which is a pinkish color and about 1mm wide), and upon the main root is a sheath of short white hairs that will become the offshoot roots.
The seedling seems to have used up al of it's stored food at this point.

There is a groove inbetween the two lobes of each leaf.  The leaves are about 7 mm wide at this point.
