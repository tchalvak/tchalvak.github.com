My proposal for a thesis:

Terraforming Mars:
In the quest to make the martian planet suitable for life, prokaryotes are the most likely candidates for transformation of and survival within the hostile martian environment.


Possible experimentation:
environmental extremes vs. bacterial survival methods:
temperature, radiation, lack of nutrients/water

bacterial/ metabolisms ability to change the environment conditions
atmospheric transformation means, rates of growth, 



Antibodies in domestic animal feed as a growth promoter.
Intestinal Bacteria
Bacterial Immunities:  Acid, heat, radiation
Magnetotactic Bacteria
Bacteria eating bacteria
Bacteria eating Virii
Terraforming using bacteria and cyanobacteria
forming using bacteria and algae
