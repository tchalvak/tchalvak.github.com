The Dexedrine has been purified to the body's chirality, while the benzedrine is still a racemic mixture.

Option b, acidic vinegar/lemon juice

We want to increase the ratio of A-/HA, since the ionized compound will be more soluble in water.

pH=pKa-log10(A-/HA)
pH-pka=-log10(A-/HA)
pKa-pH=log10(A-/HA)
10^(pKa-pH)=(A-/HA)
10^(8-pH)=large number

a low pH will increase the solubility of the compound, which would allow the poison ivy to be washed away.
