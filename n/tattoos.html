<h1>Tattoos</h1>
<p>I wonder, at the moment, whether a symbol, a tattoo, is not more one's own than one's self is.
<p>I did not choose myself, save in the very latest stages of the past, and even then it is tainted, an unbendable breakable.
<p>I would never choose an image, a concept, a thought-made-flesh, a tattoo, that was not -me-.  Otherwise it would only be another lie, another thing to put on to show the crowd.
<p>On the other hand, a reminder of what I am, who I am, who I want to be, what I must remember, what I have choosen to forget...  A milimeter push in the direction of clarity... 
<p>That is something that I could accept.
<p>A material thing can never -be- everything that we need, and even all material things could not satisfy our most important needs.  But I believe that part of the most noble purpose of things, existence, the tangible, is to remind us of those things that cannot be touched.
<p>And that is what I would have.
<p>Speculation on the future, always.  But perhaps someday I shall decide that the future has had long enough.
