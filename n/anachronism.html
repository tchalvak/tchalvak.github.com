<h2>The Other Half</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they live?  Indeed, the very question that screams at our souls is:  What are they?  This strange and frightening new species that comes at us out of the darkness and takes on the reality that we love so dear and perverts it into something more sinister than any movie could ever capture.  It is a mark of both insolence and our own indolence that we have not and that these beings know that we will not surmount our own connection to tradition and expel them from the face of the earth.  Females.
