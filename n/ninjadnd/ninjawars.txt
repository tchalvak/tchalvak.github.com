--Protocol for developement--

a  LAT GEN ese O: ok, just a quick thing about changing code
a  LAT GEN ese O: if you're going to edit code, notify everyone via aim and email
a  LAT GEN ese O: if we're online, we need to make sure we're not editting the same fil
a  LAT GEN ese O: if we're not online, we need to make sure everyone knows changes were made
a  LAT GEN ese O: if you're going to edit a file, download, edi, upload
a  LAT GEN ese O: if you need to edit over a long period of time, email us a "lock" on the file
JavaChi: if we had the space i'd put on a cvs server
a  LAT GEN ese O: "Guys, I'm locking attack_mod.php until further notice"
a  LAT GEN ese O: yeah, CVS would be nice, but we'll make do
Tchalvak: *nods*
a  LAT GEN ese O: on second thought, let's make it less chaotic
a  LAT GEN ese O: I am keeping a mirror of the test bed locally, John is keeping a back up of live
a  LAT GEN ese O: you guys always tell me when you edit a file
JavaChi: k
a  LAT GEN ese O: and always be online when you're editting
JavaChi: i need to find out when google pays
a  LAT GEN ese O: I will refrain from sending you emails every day with the 5 -10 files I updated to save on your mailbox space
Tchalvak: *laughs*
a  LAT GEN ese O: So look to me as the point of contact for all code changes
Tchalvak: *nods*
a  LAT GEN ese O: So John, should I just give Roy access to the test server and test admin panel?
JavaChi: yeah
JavaChi: but you might wanna hit some php tutorials before u look at the code on here
JavaChi: there

Later

a  LAT GEN ese O: Roy, we're doing a big live push this Sunday at 2pm
a  LAT GEN ese O: So Roy, we need to try our best to break the test server
a  LAT GEN ese O: Roy can you be on Sunday at 2?
Tchalvak: Yep.
