The most telling way to examine the effect that Campus Auxiliary Services has upon student life is to speculate what the results would be if CAS were to vanish completely.  It was probably put best by a student who said "If CAS was gone, I would have died long ago of starvation." CAS acts as a stable and continuous safety net on campus, without which we, the students, would be adrift in a sea of bad choices, most them involving not eating right, or not eating regularly.
<p>
This, therefore, goes a long way in explaining the reasons behind many of the complaints that students have about CAS.  CAS does not and -cannot- act the same as a completely independent company would, because it has to -consistently- provide the resources necessary to meet the massive and always changing demands of the thousands of students at Geneseo.

In actuality, researching College meal plans in the SUNY system seems to show that the CAS setup, i.e. cost per semester and cost per all-you-can-eat meal, falls very close to the norm.
<p>
Certainly, there are facets of CAS that need improvement, and the student body should work to suggest beneficial changes to make to CAS, but any changes that eventually do happen to CAS will require time and, more importantly, patience.
