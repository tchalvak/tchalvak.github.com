<h1>Metal Flesh</h1>
<p>For an instant, now, I see why people put things through their flesh, mark symbols on their skin, cut to bleed.  Because it makes you -feel-.  At least for a time.  You see the mark, you feel the metal, you heal the cut.  I've known for a while now that the most important thing is almost purely to feel.  Not to feel good, or bad, or up or down, but any of them, and only the power makes the difference, not the direction. 
<p>It seems perhaps that we ARE for exactly that reason.
