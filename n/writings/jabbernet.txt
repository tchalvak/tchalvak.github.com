Jabbernet
Original By Lewis Carol, adapted by Me

'Twas brillig and the broadcast storm 
Did gyre and gimble with the Lan: 
All mimsy was the college dorm, 
for the network never ran. 

"Beware the Lag Wyrm, my son! 
The routers that tear, the hubs that catch! 
Beware the Telnet app, and shun 
The faulty bandwith hatch!" 

He took his terminal in hand: 
Long time the signal noise he sought
Until pinged he, by the file tree, 
And stood awhile in thought. 

And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
The Lag Beast, with it's broadcast burst, 
Came tunnelling through it's cable cursed,
And doubled when it could!

One, two! One, two! And through and through 
the ethernet went snicker-snack! 
He left it stable, and with its cable 
He went galumphing back. 

"And hast thou slain the Lag Wyrm? 
Come to my arms, my network tech! 
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!" 
He tracerouted in his joy. 

'Twas brillig and the broadcast storm
Did gyre and gimble with the Lan: 
All mimsy was the college dorm,
for the network never ran. 
And the mome raths outgrabe.

(No Lag Wyrms were killed in the production of
this poem.)
