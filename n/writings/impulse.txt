I believe in the principle that all things are as they are made, by those who make them, and therefore contain only what the maker has, no more or less.  I say the same thing about sex and relationships, that they can only be imperfect as the parties who engaged in it.
Therefore, you can just say that it was him, as after all, there's nothing else.  Perhaps that's the way that it was from the beginning, and you just failed to notice.  Not destiny, just the past, and now only memory, to be forgotten if you can do it.

I won't lie to you, I didn't like Jack.  That's not the same thing as saying that I disliked him, just that I never could feel comfortable around him.  Perhaps you've now given me a reason to dislike him now.  I'll consider it.

Do what you have to do.  No, more than that, do anything that your anger or emotion makes you consider, even if only for the shortest of moments.  Existence is too short not to.  Regrets are too long not to.

*grins*  Not that I practice what I preach.

I wonder at the blackness that you create.  It's a darkness that contrasts with the light, but is not it's opposite.  The opposite of light is void.  What you have is something else, a darkness of emotion.  It's not a black of death, rather the opposite, like a tangible liquid oil, where do you find it?  I guess.  I'd ask, but it's not something that can be told anyway.  
It's something that I lack, though I can't say I envy you your possesion of it.  I've known others who have had it, and it seems to materialize only after pain.  I don't have the darkness, but I don't know if I would say that I have light either, I'm less passive than that, more disconnected.  It's a problem, what used to be a solution, now just growing old in a cage, it's ties severed.

Can people be broken into elements?  I may babble that they can, but who knows...  You certainly don't have to agree with me.

Survive with your darkness intact.

Inspired anew,
me.
