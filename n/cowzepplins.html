<h1>Cow Zepplins, attack!</h1>
This morning I dreamt of a world where the many forces of good amass superhero style armies to repel the hordes of evil, and I was the leader of (and one of) a fleet of tiny, red, zepplins driven by black and white holstein cows, with the special ability to shrink to invisibility.
  
<br>A war over the planet began, and two of the enemies that I remember most vividly were mechanoid robot santa and an immense serpent demon.
<br>Luckily as allies I had a group of friendly hawaiian bankers, who evidently were allied to me because they owed me 5 or 6 "mundo" dollars (which is either some huge amount on that world or just hawaiian slang).  My zepplins and our bankers had a base in hollowed out tunnels that ran throughout a mountain, but our base was quickly taken by the mecha-santa and his hench-men.  I would certainly have overcome them had I not then woken up.

The game rights have been bought by LucasArts and will ship in October.
