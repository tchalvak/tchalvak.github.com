<h1>Jabbernet</h1>
<h3>An adaptation from Lewis Caroll's Poem.</h3>
<p><br>
'Twas brillig and the broadcast storm 
<p>Did gyre and gimble with the Lan: 
<p>All mimsy was the college dorm, 
<p>for the network never ran. 
<p><br>
"Beware the Lag Wyrm, my son! 
<p>The routers that tear, the hubs that catch! 
<p>Beware the Telnet app, and shun 
<p>The faulty bandwith hatch!" 
<p><br>
He took his terminal in hand: 
<p>Long time the signal noise he sought
<p>Until pinged he, by the file tree, 
<p>And stood awhile in thought. 
<p><br>
And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
<p>The Lag Beast, with it's broadcast burst, 
<p>Came tunnelling through it's cable cursed,
<p>And doubled when it could!
<p><br>
One, two! One, two! And through and through 
<p>the ethernet went snicker-snack! 
<p>He left it stable, and with its cable 
<p>He went galumphing back. 
<p><br>
"And hast thou slain the Lag Wyrm? 
<p>Come to my arms, my network tech! 
<p>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!" 
<p>He tracerouted in his joy. 
<p><br>
'Twas brillig and the broadcast storm
<p>Did gyre and gimble with the Lan: 
<p>All mimsy was the college dorm,
<p>for the network never ran. 
<p>And the mome raths outgrabe.
<p><br>
(No Lag Wyrms were killed in the production of
this poem.)
