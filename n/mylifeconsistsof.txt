My life consists of:
Killing myself with sleep.  Killing myself with lack of sleep.  Immobility.  Being constantly foiled at doing the very thing that I adore doing, i.e. swimming.  Pretending that I know what I'm doing.  No, I mean literally, since I work on computers, and computers don't have a rhyme or reason, in the end.
Fuck, how do you do this?  *laughs*  I can't believe you've managed to put me into a good mood.  How?  This doesn't work with anyone else.
Anyway, what else:  Oh yes, pretending that I'm a christian and can stomach the evil propaganda of the christian religions; intolerance of difference and original sin, pretending that I'm interested in a long term relationship when I don't even know if I can keep up a short term relationship and it's all really about feeling close at least to someone, instead of the complete isolation that I have fallen into amidst an excess of people.  Killing my mind with my new laptop that I shouldn't have bought with money from a check that my grandfather said might bounce that I haven't talked to him about, doing nothing creative with it except writing you.
You're my anchor point.  Not to the reality that other people believe in, but rather something better.  No idea what exactly that is, but it is.

I just realized that I have lost it.  I had it at one point, a lack of inaction, every second I would be productive, in one way or another, drawing/writing/reading/something.  Mostly a tactic to keep myself from getting bored that worked.  Then I came back to geneseo.  I don't think that I'm bored these days, just... losing time that shouldn't be lost?  I don't seem to find myself doing things that count any more.
