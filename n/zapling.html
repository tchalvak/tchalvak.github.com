<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often wonder what I am doing, where I am going, and why.  There are never any answers to these questions, and so instead of contemplating them I create work web-site.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem with all of the things that I do in my life is this lack of direction.  Either that or the saving grace of my life is the fact that I have no direction.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose that this will be found out at some point in the future.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I wish to tell you a story. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am essentially a slow to anger person.  However, there are some things that easily and quickly make me very annoyed.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing that gets me is ping-pong.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just yesterday I was having a friendly ping-pong game with a friend, and as usual, I was losing.  Its not that I can't take losing, its that I can't deal with the slow but inevitable sinking feeling that accompanies it in ping-pong.  It is one of the few times that I find myself getting mad, and I truly do mean Mad.  Strange that It tends to make me so insane.  I can't explain it, really.  Of course, I will say that it may be because I enjoy the game so much, and that is partially due to my habit of frequently losing in it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are the times that I win in ping-pong, and though those are not times of rejoicing, they at least are not times of sorrow.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always, unfortunately, feel sorry for my associate, when I win, however.  Sometime I wonder if it's not better all around for me to lose .</font>
