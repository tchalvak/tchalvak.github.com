Well, of course.  See, I think that you're going about it the wrong way, all that you have to do to rp an alchoholic is -emote- the action of drinking the liquid as opposed to actually drinking it.  *shrugs*

dNaeX  says that KaVir needs to stop eating those spicy foods before he goes off to bed.

Also, I view the whole "Details of eating" as a rather unnecessary thing.  I believe that "You feel pangs of hunger." and "You are thirsty." are both the most detail that should be gone into, and even then only in small amounts, if at all.

I notice that no one seems to want to code the specifics of their character's -other- bodily functions, Mmmmmm?  Hypocrites.  *grins*

        dNaeX out.
