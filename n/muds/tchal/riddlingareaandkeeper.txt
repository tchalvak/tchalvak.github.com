Premise:

This area is made up of four rooms.  The initial 
room is accessed easily through the square door, while the other rooms
are all inaccessable [At least I want them to be so] save if one answers
the riddles posed by the arachnid within the center room [using talk-
files].  The answer to each riddle opens up a certain door [scripts
needed?].  Within each room is another puzzle involving an object 
[Think play-acting, i.e. invisible script-mob watches players action
for certain string and if string is present, triggers a responding effect[conjecture, 
unsure if possible]]. Correct usage opens the container in that room and allows access
to the spell-learning device within that container.

Note: that I have no idea which parts of this, if any, are feasable under
the current constraints of the present building system.  Thus, if you see
something that you don't think will work, tell me.

The curving black walls of this chamber turn it into a smooth
sphere, interrupted by four portals in each direction.  Each
gate is closed by flawlessly interlocking plates, and each is
of a different shape.  There is a square of dull black metal,a
red-bronze circle, a silver triangle, and a grey iron oval.

*set r act2 A wide, circular strip of the room suddenly splits from the rest and slides half of the distance of the sphere and stops, interchanging the location of two of the gates.

 allowing players to type "l four-armed" "l statue" and "l four"... but I digress.]

*cdesc statue
The figure appears to be an an alien creature, with a four-
armed torso set upright upon a scaly, sinuous lower body
that extends to the ground behind it, tapering into a tail.
The statue is supported by four thick legs, long and multi-
jointed, which attach to the bottom of it's lower body. It's
angular, black head has six faceted jewels set on opposite
sides along the edge, large and irregular rubies. Each of the
eight limbs are composed of three sections of smooth silver
metal, seperated by thinner joint areas, where the metal is 
slightly cracked and tarnished. At the end of the limbs are
three triangular black claws, shining obsidian with jagged
edges.

[Note: Eventually, attackers would probably either A: Die, B:
Kill it and find themselves trapped, or C: kill it and find that
only the opening back out has opened up, none of the doors for
a successful answer to the riddle, depending upon how the script
is eventually set up. This is because the point of the creature
is not to engage in combat, but to set forth the riddles and 
reward correct answers.]

What force and strength cannot get through, I with a gentle touch can do. 
And many in the street would stand, were I not a friend at hand.
