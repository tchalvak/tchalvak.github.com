Story: The relative calm of chaos

^RBlood^x.  It is all that We see any more, the world is red.  We scent it forever on Our hands, its warmth burns Us.  That is not why We were here, We were the Devourers, We consume from within, We do not need to lead Us to victory, We simply help them to defeat themselves.  But now it is all blood.
---
The spinning color of a mad sky, its cycles of light and darkness coming without rhyme or reason, heralded only by a change in the sounds that spawned from the living flesh of the land below it.  The bodies of the fallen formed the soil, the stones were of bone, and blood was as water.  The living sky, joining without horizon to the land, broiled with a reflection of the madness below, tiny wisps of fleeting clouds whirling through quick bursts of lightning, shattering and whirling in ways that mimic the shapes and movement of wild beasts.
---
When the ^GPestilence^x faded, that was the beginning. It left only one coin, spinning on its edge.  What devours within when sickness, strife, and death are gone, and only twisting shadows remain.
---
The shapes in the darkness below the swirling clouds approach the slope, dragging themselves like the broken castoffs of a blind toymaker.  They gather together as they come, clambering noisily over the toppled trunks of rotting trees, and sliding clumsily on the flesh of their own brethren.  Groups of them approach from the same side of the slope, as they have no tactics, no sentience, only numbers and the frenzy that drives them.
---
And then the ^Tshattering^x, honor bonds and bindings broken, the wound burning again, eyesight fading in pools of blood, slivers of crystal burrowing through bone.
---
The beasts throw themselves at the silhouettes of thin, insect-like forms that stand in a tight ring of unnatural ruinic patterns around a small shape in the center.  As each beast touches the edge of the wall of spindly shadows, it is engulfed by one of the branching, warped forms, and both beast and shadow vanish. Soon the sheer number of the monstrosities surrounds the cleared circle, and the dim flashes of muted lightning begin to show gaps left in the ring of shadow runes.
---
Now We whisper half-truths at Us from all sides, speak of ^Ydesecration^x and ruins, buried plans and birthed vessels.  So delicate, a glass chalice, easily dropped, and something nameless seeks to pour from it.  But the flesh itself is raw.  So We must build instead of devour.  A twisting, a twisting.
---
The shape in the center of the cleared area vanishes in a wisp of shadow, taking the contorted shadows with it, and the circle collapses into a boiling tangle of ravening beasts that tear at each other and themselves in their fury.



Respond to the "IC gems" idea.


Gtell:
I think that part of the problem that Gtell has is that its obvious and major advantages (no effort required to format the communication or put it in-character, stands out very well from combat spam, allows communication regardless of location, allows communication that others in the same location cannot spy upon) and lack of disadvantages (no cost in any way) is an rp-killer, because gtell is far, far, far superior to using say.

Therefore, I propose that we 

A:  spread some of those advantages around to make gtell less of the best and most efficient choice.  For example, the concept of being able to signal within your group
requiring an individual priming of the group members, and allowing for detection and understanding of the signals by smart/skilled watchers.
B:  decrease the lack of clarity of combat that makes says a inefficient alternative  (Efficient assignment of colors is a very important aspect of clarity in combat)
C:  give gtell disadvantages and a cost that will increase the use of says for the things that are appropriate for says, and 


Making spellcasting more interesting:

Even the longest casting-length spell is rediculously short (though I'm not sure exactly how long the longest is).  

Spells( or maybe just call them rituals) that takes increments of game hours.

Material components.  Do they have possibility?

Regen zeroing affects.




Reply to "oath of silence" idea:

Problem 1:  Gtell.  Any "oath of silence" would simply shuttle communication to gtell and that'd be rather weak.
Problem 2:  Spell duration.  Most spells will carry over for quite a bit.  During that time, the monk is going to get excessively stacked bonuses.  And many of those spells carry over for a very long time.  So you spell yourself up, enter the oath of silence, fight for a bit with grotesque bonuses, and then go idle until the oath wears off.
Problem 3:  Cancellation is non-verbal, so that would be a method of ending the oath right away.


You also have a problem where you proposed compensating for a lack for the active benefit of heal (you have to cast heal each time you want the benefit,  it doesn't have an affect with a duration, and it requires you to sacrifice magic and a command-round to do it) with the passive benefit of an affect (which would operate at all times without taking a command-round or magic beyond the initial 10 seconds of mana regen to replenish).

Think about what the actual disadvantage to the monk is comparative to.  Initially, it's essentially like the monk were hit by a silence spell.  Now, normally when monks are hit by a silence spell, they really aren't all that hard off, 'cause they're freaking masters of melee, so you've really just gotten rid of their spellcasting, not their ability to output damage at all.  After a long time, the continued duration of the oath of silence would be like a slow cancellation of their spells, so towards the end of the duration of the oath it would be as if they were both silenced and dispelled/cancelled.  Even in that situation, monks are going to be as well off as any spellcaster

Request for legion clan mount.

This mob would be purchasable at a clan-only legion store,
and I'd also like to get one of them as a reset in the clanhall.

Race: nightmare
short description: a nightmare beast
in-room description: [Nightmare] A hazy beast made of shadows, smoke, and flame.
keywords: nightmare beast hazy
Vague in shape, this creature has burning eyes like coals mounted in an
hazy, flickering body of shadows that seems to flow and change like water,
but favor the muted hues of blood and darkness.  It does not appear to be
flesh and blood, or even solid at all, but four limbs of wavering grey smoke
extend down from a vaguely equine body and head to fuse with the ground.

I would like to pay to get the nightmare to have "passdoor" and "flying", 
as high of physical stats as possible (most importantly con), and be level 99.












As for how you think, scientific research may work like that, people don't.  Their mind makes snap judgements and decides -something- and then they feel that way, even if they don't know what to think rationally.

So I'm really more interested in what you feel about it.  You may not know what to think, yet, but I'm sure that you feel something about it already.

Illusionist ideas:

Mislead other maladiction (hallu, if it worked, would be this)
Lens:  make it focus illusion and give it to illusionists.
barrier:  reflects sound and light spells.

make ideas to turn sappers into burglars, and vice versa.




Heh, you didn't get my pregrad check material because it was sent to Robert Simon (and the Bio Department) like everything in the past.  (Evidently the administration can't take a hint.)  So, I dropped by the Bio office and was going to just have Simon do it, but then the Bio secretary said that if you had been my advisor all along, that I could do it with you if that made more sense.

I figured that since I had never talked with the guy before, much less about the classes that I'm taking, that it might be better to just do this stuff with you.

I actually was supposed to have my pregrad. check done last year/semester, and now they're given me some kind of ultimatim that it has to be done by the end of this month.

But I'm open to getting a new perspective on it anyway (and probably having him point out that it doesn't look like I'm going to graduate on time).  Either way is fine by me, so if you want me to talk to Robert Simon instead, I'll just do that.

Leadership reply idea:

 1. Ragnar hasn't yet declared himself as to whether he purposefully wants the
 2. class with the highest grouping -skills- to automatically have to not only
 3. organize the group, but also choose the path that the group follows, or
 4. whether, on the other hand, the inability of a leader of a large group to
 5. follow anyone who doesn't happen to have certain rather arbitrary skills.  
 6. 
 7. That doesn't change the fact that as it stands, the situation is complete and utter
 8. bullshit.
 9.  
10. The leader of groups almost exclusively becomes whoever has, in order:
11. leadership, a higher skill in leadership, tactics, and a higher skill with tactics.
12. The reason that that is bullshit is because when the number in your group
13. determines your ability to level, -Real- leadership becomes ignored in favor
14. of the skill.  Real leadership (yes, even on xaos) can't be gained through
15. the knowledge tree.
16.  
17. As far as I see it, the roles in group levelling are:
18. leader
19. navigator
20. tank(s)
21.  
22. Tanks should be determined by who can take the damage.
23. Navigation should be determined by who knows the areas and where to go.
And leadership should be determined by skills and 



Legion Charter
 
* Hiring policy on types of Clanguard:
  No undead, usually only clanguard that are now "tainted" or changed in some way beyond their normal race, with the exception of the priests.
 
* Player recruitment rules:
  No undead. All who join must follow Albach. None may advance beyond the first rank of the clan without having been marked by Albach, the leader of the clan, or one of those chosen by Albach to give the mark.
 
* Long-term clan goals:
  Getting a member of the legion inside each of the other most powerful clans.  Having legion members gain power within other clans, preferrably with no knowledge of their membership in the legion.  Feeding information to enemy clans that indicates that other enemy clans are taking hostile action.
 
* Method of choosing a new leader:
  Tested and Chosen by Albach, in the meantime the highest ranking member of the highest level at the time of the loss of the old leader is the leader.
 
* Races, classes, and other clans the clan would be mainly aligned with:
  Any clan that is not affiliated directly with another relgion and that opposes the same enemy.  The legion will not take a subservient role in any alliance.  The legion will not align with any predominantly good clan unless it is to use it as a tool in a more broadly reaching plan for evil.  The clan itself will make no alliances with kender, pixies, or avariel.
 
* Any other information on the clan that would be useful for the admin:

Please, give a "resize" spell to transmuters.
 
 
Transmuters will love to have it, everyone else will love transmuters
 having it, and it makes a lot of sense.
 
-The expense and imbalance of hero-point dependent resize-
 
Knowing, every time that you have to resize, that you could have used
 the points on stats or trains that will never be lost, but you needed
 a good weapon to wield until the next time someone loots and sacrifices
 it, is very painful.
Knowing that the other races of the more represented sizes don't have
 to, is also painful.
 
For sizes under-represented in equipment power/abundance, PK has the
 obvious 1 hero point cost, and then it has the more hidden cost of
 having to resize a whole new set of equipment.  With both theft and
 PK, it's very easy to burn through piles of hero points in this way.
 
If you sacrifice HP to hero empower a weapon, you are choosing between
 the weapon, or the weapon just a slight bit better.  Resizing is
 sacrificing simply to wear or wield the item at all, a choice between
 an item or nothing at all.
 
-Benefits of a "resize" spell-
 
If resize were made less costly, it would benefit everyone, but it
 would benefit the sizes that are deficient more than the sizes that
 aren't, making for a more level playing field.
 
Asking for builders to alleviate the problem is an impossibility.  There
 will always be one size of item that is more abundant and powerful, no
 matter which size that is. And there will always be sizes with weak and
 rare equipment.  There are 11 sizes available. The idea that builders can
 give each equal power and number is unworkable.  Giving players the access
 to a source of modification that doesn't cost them the effectiveness of
 their character, on the other hand, will allow players to provide each
 equipment size with -EXACTLY- the amount of power and abundance that is
 called for.
 
-Potential for abuse-
 
You resize items to:
wear them
wield them
two hand them
have them weigh more
 
So where is there any potential for abuse in those, under the new system?
 
Besides that, just as enchanters are hard to get to work for you, if
 "resize" were given to transmuters, it would still be a challenge
 to find and get them to do the resizing.
 
 
Please, resize spell for transmuters.

idea subject I think that some of these are rules more than rights.
idea to Altair Ragnar all
idea reply 2260

Rules are fine, makes sense for the expansion of the roleplaying rules
to occur at the same time as the rights, but I think that they would
go in a different sections.  

For example:

Rules:
-Newbies are not to be killed without provocation.
Punishment: HCXP for one day/Freezing for one Week/Perma-Freeze


RP rules:
Eternals are the judges of RP, refer issues with another character's
roleplaying to them with a tell or in a "note to admin".
Eternals can invisibly audit your roleplaying at any time if you are HCRP.
-<aspect of roleplaying broken> (successive punishments)
-Allying/grouping with racial enemies without reason:  
(Warning/Warning/day of HCXP/week of HCXP)
-Hours races allying with racial or clan enemies without good reason:
(Warning/Warning/Week of HCXP)
-Drastically breaking alignment and racial RP without good reason:
e.g. evil troll paladin guarding lawful good fire giant mage
(Warning/day of HCXP/Week of HCXP)
-Minor break with alignment or racial RP without good reason:
(Warning/Warning/Warning/day of HCXP)

Right:
-The worst punishment that you can receive for a roleplaying
infraction is HCXP.  (roleplaying infractions do not include:
abusing bugs, spamkilling, unprovoked newbie killing, or any other
infrations that are ooc in nature)

-Penalties over (time it takes for penalties to fall off penalty spool) cannot
be counted against a character's record.

-You have the right to appeal any that is permanent.  All punishments that
are permanent will 

Builder to all
builder subject naga/slaan: Inclusion of race naga, alterations, and classes.
builder ++

I would like Naga to be included in the slaan/naga area because:
 
They are very much -not- human, even more different than slaan are
and I hope that this will help keep the slaan from becoming green, 
scaled humans. as well as satisfying my need for uniqueness while
still allowing the populance to get their almost standard lizard men.
They'll help make for a hierarchy (e.g. the Drow, Trolls) which can make 
roleplay more interesting.
 
 
 
Classes available in the Citadel:
Base Warrior, Paladin, and Knight trainers.
Base shaman, and Rift Binder trainers.
Base thief trainer.
 
Both can be shaman or warrior.
Only slaan can be theives.
 
Proposed Alterations to races:
Albach had a good idea, to have the equipment size for naga
be the same as the slaan, but the overall race size be one larger,
which fits the idea of transformation well.  I prefer slaan as medium,
but don't really care which size the slaan actually end up being beyond
that there is the size difference between the two races.

 
Naga still need taillash skill and ridable trait,
I dislike the way that the "hit" verb for naga occurs in combat, it's really
not descriptive of where the damage is coming from.  Is there any "crush"
or "constriction" or other more appropriate damage verb?  If there isn't 
really any racial damtype more descriptive than "hit", then I'd prefer it be
"claw" attacks.

idea subject Slaan/Vondonni/Kobold warrior subclass:  Beast or Beastial
idea to all
idea ++
 
The following is 1/10th original, and 9/10ths a compilation of things that 
people have proposed before.
 
Warrior Subclass Beastial
 
Rending: Small, stackable decreases to an opponents hitpoint regen while attacking, from bites.
 
Lockjaw: Attempts to a bite, which if successful, cuts down on opponents dex.
 
Savage Resistance: natural increase to magic resistance and armor class when not
wearing armor.
 
Pounce: Unmounted charge that extends only one room, possible knockdown.
 
Heightened Senses: Ability to see mobs/pcs regardless of being blinded or invisibility.
Only mobs, though, not 
 
Pack Style:  increases to the abilities of everyone grouped with user, decrease 
to the users abilities, two in style harbringer in the same group will give a 
minor benefit, the more in the same group, the more the benefits stack.
For example, +2 strength +1 dex to everyone else while they're grouped, user gets a -1 strength and -1 dex, and more users in the group stack benefits.
 
Strike: Using this skill, the beast uses all its weight and effort to bring down 
and immobilize its prey, then relies upon its pack-mates to finish it.
(Dependent upon strength, Prey is forced into a resting position, Beast cannot 
attack while holding it's prey down.)
 
Pre-existing skills:
Perception + Extreme Perception
Cannibalism
Ambush
Leadership



idea to all
idea subject Allowing PC-led clan start locations.
idea ++
 
Inspiration:
Tritower, Visari, etc.
 
Premise:
If a pc-led clan is able to meet a certain set of strict requirements,
they then have the option of buying a start location for a certain
race and base class.
These new start locations then appear in the creation menu in the
seperate category "Player Controlled Start Locations" and are only
shown to players that are no longer newbie status.
 
 
Requirements:
No hours races or npc races.  (of course)
Pre-established clanhall on the prime plane required.
Clan must have at least one trainer for the base class that they
request the start location of.
Clans must have a training pole or magic bubble.
Clans must purchase a minimum of 10 training dummies.
And maybe also:
Clans must be "recognized" status clans to recruit membership
from the public in this way.



A hooded demon is using:
<worn on neck>       [large   ] a Demonknight's cape
<worn on torso>      [large   ] the nexus platemail
<worn on head>       [large   ] a demonknight's hood
<worn on legs>       [medium  ] a black battle skirt

======================================================================

Style:Roleplaying
Code base:Xaos 1.0/Rom 2.3
Born: May 1997
Implimentor: Ragnar
Levels: 100 base + 750 level-less
Classes:5 with 27 subdivisions
Races: 25 with detailed start locations, 100s of supporting races.

Xaos is a roleplaying mud, pure and simple.  It has dozens of races to
suit any RPer's needs and is very easy to add another race if there is a
gap.  Totally custom areas built by the OLC team.  All additions beyond
what little is left of the base coda and OLC have been built by
its implimentor, 'patches are for wussies :P'.  We feature the 4 prime
classes and 25 subclasses split among them to subclass into upon hitting
50th level.  Xaos has 100 mortal levels, 10 levels of immortality and
features _no_ remort/reclass system that drops a mortal's level and gives
the misconceptions that it has more levels then it really does.  We
feature well over 1000 skills/spells that encompase a full range of catagories from
pure combat through to the purely entertaining.  We have one global
channel (OOC) and all mortal communications are
made through more 'realistic' methods like say, sayto, whisper and
yell.  We feature a language system without a 'universal' beginner.

Xz's eyes are blind slits lacking pupils, but they blaze with a ^Rcrimson^^ light.
Most of his face is bound in coarse black cloth, the same material that clothes
the rest of his body save for a few curved plates of mithril armor. Where visible   
under the cloth, the skin of the left side of his body is rough, covered with    
overlapping, angular ebon scales. On the right side, the skin becomes smooth,   
like a worn stone. His right arm is fluidly muscled, while his left is withered 
and gaunt, ravaged as if by a burning hunger. Bright, ^Rblood-red^^ tattoos     
cover the visible parts of his skin, a stylized design that taken in parts      
resembles nothing more than strange runes, but as a whole form a writhing       
centipede. Seared above his eyes is an unhealed crescent that forms the jaws of 
the insectoid beast.  There is the slight scent of seared flesh. His mouth is   
often twisted into an amused smile, almost a snarl, showing a few sharp white   
teeth that contrast against his skin.
