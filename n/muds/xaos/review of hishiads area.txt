[Mobs]

Mob 162200: a vicious crackling harpy
Descriptions: Pretty good, pretty good.
Mechanics: Looks good.

Mob 162201: a bright spark
Descriptions: Minor typo, figures -> figure's, and might be better to cut down 
the keywords a smidge to avoid conflicts.  
Mechanics: Mmm, the faerie fire flagging a lightning spark looks strange, seems 
like you'd be better off just giving them + light.

Mob 162202: a lightning golem
Descriptions: Nothing major.
Mechanics: Looks fine, assuming that having it level 100 but base warrior was 
purposeful.


Mob 162203: the matriarch
Descriptions: Looks good.
Mechanics: Looks good.

Mob 162250: an undead mine worker
Descriptions: Whoa, I'd suggest trying to pare down the keywords a little, if 
you can. Otherwise looks good.
Mechanics: Looks good.

Why the single object and single mob vnum at the end of the area, with nothing 
inbetween?  Made me have to look through lots of empty vnums for more.
And, 5 mob vnums seems kinda... sparse, but maybe that'll be made up by other 
sections.


[Objects]

Object 162200: a pile of loose rubble
Descriptions: Hahah, was puzzled for a moment there, but I like it.
Mechanics: Looks good, traps are fun.

Object 162201: a heap of rubble
Descriptions: Good enough.
Mechanics: Nopurge usually jus' causes annoyances if the object gets changed, 
doesn't seem necessary on furniture, but whatever.

Object 162202: a tremendous statue
Descriptions: Look good.
Mechanics: Nopurge seems unnecessary.

Object 162203: a tremendous statue
Descriptions: Almost identical to previous object, would have been more 
exciting if it were a trap, but not all objects can aspire so high.  :p  
Otherwise fine.
Mechanics: Nopurge seems unnecessary.

Object 1162204: a scattered pile of stone debris
Descriptons: Fine.
Mechanics: Fine.

Object 162205: the cracked statue of a giant
Descriptions: Fine.
Mechanics: Fine.

Mechanics: Eh, nopurge again.

Object 162207: rusting armplates
Descriptions: Fine.
Mechanics: Fine.

Mechanics: Fine.

Descriptions: Fine.
Mechanics: Fine.

Object 162250: a random hero item
Descriptions: Fine for a random.
Mechanics: Hard for me to say how powerful of a random this is, I guess just 
matters that it goes on something appropriate.


[Rooms]

Mechanics:
add indoors for room: 162200, 162203, 162205,
Nowhere flag doesn't do anything, but that won't hurt anything.
Descriptons:
Room 162203: A watch tower: it's head -> its head, it's body -> it's body, 
Room 162246: Before the Garrison: it's ruin -> its ruin


[Overall]

The objects are numerous and help tell the story of the place, and there's a 
trap in there to liven things up, and some of the mobs seem to be configured 
with the area to assist in an interesting way, so it should be a fun area.  I 
kinda want to know what caused all the destruction, now.  And the miner's path 
sign is sweet.  So other than the things above and the testing that you 
mentioned, the area should be great.
