The room is filled with a large number of blue-green fungi that glow softly with a phosphorescent blue light.  They spread out from the rough stone walls of the cavern like fans, and some are as large enough to take shelter under from the incessant dripping of the moisture from the small holes in the rock of the ceiling.

The chamber is composed of lofting pillars of rock that rise from the stone floor to the 
ceiling, mostly covered with strange growths, hanging strings of fleshy slime that end in a 
small globe that dangles that seem to thrive on the water that trickles down the rock.
Soft piles of lichens and mosses intertwined make up a sheath of green and black across the 
stone of the tunnel, and fill the air with a musty, acrid smell. To the north and the south 
the tunnel is open, leading onwards into moist obscurity.
