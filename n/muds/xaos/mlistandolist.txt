Description:
Colored an incredible shade of ochre, this asp is the largest of it's kind
you have ever seen.  It's thin body is still thick enough to wrap around a
troll and the length of it is unfathomable by just looking at it.  A low
hiss escapes its mouth whenever it's forked tongue flickers into the air. It
keeps it's head raised as it slithers towards you swaying it's head
hypnotically, it's large snake eyes centered on you.

Description:
A large purple snake slithers along the over ground with little effort
considering it's size. A long and thick body seems to go on endlessly as it
moves slowly and rythmically. Purple and blue patterns on the snake's body
seem to distract any prey it hunts. A pale forked tongue and gleaming yellow
eyes seem to tell you that the snake might just be hungry.

Description:
A medium sized naga stands before you, half serpant half woman. The lower
half is decorated with pink and green patterns in her scales while the upper
half of her body resembles a young teenage girl with dark red skin and deep
purple hair that is uncut and hangs down defeated over her head. Long,
strong arms have dark runes painted onto them and in her right hand a club
of stone is gripped tightly. Her face is hidden partly because of the hair
but a malicious grin with dirty razor sharp teeth can be seen as she grins
at you.

beast into shreds effortlessly.  A feathered head holds itself up proudly as
it snaps it's long curved beak into the air.  In it's eyes you can see a
wisdom in them that could only be bestowed by nature.  However it is now
staring at you, the intruder, with a hungry gleam.
