Room 27050
The third like of the desc is indented, not sure if you meant to do
or not.
^Y>>>^^Just a peculiarity with how the .f command works, but I got rid of the indentation manually.
 
Room 27097 etc
I like the atmosphere added by the dripping water echoes..
^Y>>>^^I agree, though the dripping water echo occurs far too frequently for my 
taste, but I'd rather have it do it a lot than not be there at all.
 
Room 27077
How about replacing the dripping water echoe with an echoe for the
exploding spore capsules?  Might spice it up a bit, as there are
dripping water ones all over the place.
^Y>>>^^Yeah, a pretty cool idea for an echo to add, but the echos would overlap and 
become rather spammy.  Perhaps if it were possible to decrease the dripping echo I'd 
do this, but I'm not going to worry about it at the moment.  Perhaps if players 
complain about the excess dripping.  These echos don't go by room, they spread out a 
certain distance from each room that you place them on, like gate runes, so it's not 
so easy to use multiple ones and still avoid overlap.
 
Room 27084 (and other lava rooms)
What about adding an echo for the bubbles of lava that burst?  Could 
just add to the atmopshere of the place.
^Y>>>^^I think that the effects of the lava will probably give enough (painful) 
atmosphere on their own.
 
Mob 27051
"Long descr:A large black dog with red eyes lies on it's haunches."
Sits on its haunches would work better.
And it says it's level 101.
^Y>>>^^You're right, having it say sit does work better, so it does now.  And it is 
supposed to be level 101.
 
Mob 27057
I thought all crystalline type dragons were neutral only.  And this one is
and evil hydra.  If I'm wrong, then it looks good.  If I'm right, then perhaps
a chromatic brown tone would work.
^Y>>>^^This is the result of the fact that the hydra only exists as an index to the 
hydra npc, which is where I put the actual description that would appear on the 
npc-mob (one that fits how a hydra would look) but I also added the right desc to the mob index, so it's all good now.
 
Mob 27057
Level 103 (Hero 200)  ... I dind't know that was possible.  I'm assuming it's 
supposed to be possible?  I think?
^Y>>>^^Purposeful.
 
Mob 27064
Second line of desc is indented.
^Y>>>^^Another instance of .f formatting gone awry, fixed manually.
 
Mob 27066
Desc just needs to be formatted.
^Y>>>^^You're right, good catch.
 
Mob 27073
There's no desc for this mob.
^Y>>>^^Right again, though I remember writing the desc for it out before, not sure 
where it went.  Has a desc now.
 
Obj 17050
If mouths is going to be used in short and names, then perhaps you should add it so the long desc as well.
^Y>>>^^Nah, when they step through it they'll get a message with the short desc, so 
it'll get seen that way.
 
Obj 27087
It's at level 107.
^Y>>>^^Level 1 now, good catch.
 
Obj 27088
Not sure if you're using this one.  If you are, it has no names.
Obj 27094
No names, no short.
^Y>>>^^I ended up using other objects, which made these ones unecessary.
 
^Y>>>^^So, who wants to help the Slaan/Naga go online by reviewing one or more of the 
two remaining areas?  You know you want to.  Reply to this note if you're available, 
or simply use the request for reviews that I posted earlier.
