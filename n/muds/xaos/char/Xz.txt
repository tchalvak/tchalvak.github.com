Xz's eyes are blind slits lacking pupils, but they blaze with a ^Rcrimson^^ 
light. Most of his face is bound in coarse black cloth, the same material
that clothes the rest of his body save for a few curved plates of mithril
armor. Where visible under the cloth, the skin of the left side of his body
is rough, covered with overlapping, angular ebon scales. On the right side,
the skin becomes smooth, like a worn stone. His right arm is fluidly
muscled, while his left is withered and gaunt, ravaged as if by a burning
hunger. Bright, ^Rblood-red^^ tattoos cover the visible parts of his skin, a
stylized design that taken in parts resembles nothing more than strange
runes, but as a whole forms a writhing centipede. Seared above his eyes is
an unhealed crescent that forms the jaws of the insectoid beast. There is
the slight scent of seared flesh. His mouth is usually twisted into an
amused smile, almost a snarl, showing a few sharp white teeth that contrast
against his skin.

Xz's eyes are blind slits lacking pupils, but they blaze with a crimson
light. Most of his face is bound in coarse black cloth, the same material
that clothes the rest of his body under a few curved plates of mithril
armor. Where visible where the cloth, the skin of the left side of his body
is rough, covered with overlapping, angular ebon scales. On the right side,
the skin becomes smooth like a worn stone.  Seared above his eyes is an
unhealed burn, the shape of a crescent, which glows a dull red. There is the
slight scent of seared flesh. His right arm is fluidly muscled, while his
left is withered and gaunt, ravaged as if by a burning hunger.

[[Replace with the crimson centipede tattoo, which is how the object will come afterwards.]]


 Many
phosphorescent runes cover his body, hovering designs etched onto
nothingness like a complicated puzzle. They closely surround his form, never
quite touching, and flare softly when he moves. 

He often displays an
amused smile, almost a snarl, barely showing sharp, white teeth that contrast
with his skin.
