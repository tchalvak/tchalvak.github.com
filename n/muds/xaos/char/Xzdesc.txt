Xz's eyes are blind slits lacking pupils, but they ^Rblaze^^ with a crimson 
light.  The left side of his body is scaly, covered with angular ebon 
plates.  On the right side, the skin becomes smooth like a worn stone. 
Seared above his eyes is an unhealed burn, the shape of a crescent, which 
glows a dull red.  There is the slight scent of seared flesh.  On the right 
side of his body, his limbs are silkily muscular, while on the left they are
ravaged, withered as if by the burning hunger of starvation.  He often wears
an amused smile, almost a snarl, showing a few sharp ^Wwhite^^ teeth that 
contrast against his skin.
