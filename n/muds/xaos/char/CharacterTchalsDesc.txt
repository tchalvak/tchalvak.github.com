In actuality, his two forms, yakisheeni and reaver, look strangely,
vaguely similar, both having black protrusions coming from the back
of the head, though they're horns in the yakisheeni and tentacles in
the reaver, both sporting six limbs, and sharp and wide black claws.
The similarities end there, as the reaver form is, of course, a 
twenty foot, two ton, mandibled insectoid creature covered with 
chitinous plates, and the yaksheeni form is a metalic, beastial dragon
spanning about 750 feet from head to tail, and weighs nearly two-
thousand tons, thus more than most buildings.  Also, the yaksheeni 
form has an unfurled wingspan of nearly the same length.  Neither
form has eyes, nose or ears per se, but instead combines them all
in eye-like organs

Bio:

Tchal is, in essence, insane to the core.  He hates the color black 
with insane and unreasoning fury, and he wields void magic.  He
thinks that he is a reaver, though he was actually originally a 
yakisheeni who thought that he was a reaver, but now that his powers
have progressed to the ability to morph, he can turn into a reaver, 
at which point he thinks himself to be a yakisheeni.
His favorite color is red, and he likes red to the inverse extent that
he hates black.  [Note: Many races have red blood.]
His two forms, the twenty foot, two ton, insectoid reaver form, and
the seven hundred and fifty foot, two-thousand ton, metallic, beastial
dragon form, are very different, to say the least.
To make things simpler for himself, he considers almost all creatures
as "bags-of-flesh," sometimes even undead, which he lumps in the same
category by rationalizing that they once were "bags-of-flesh," and, 
depending upon his mood, even incorporeal beings, which he lumps in
with wraiths, thus still "flesh-bags".  Again, he is very insane.
