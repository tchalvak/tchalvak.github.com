Subject: A Hrielith comedy in Five Acts. [Information]

[Just thought that y'all might find this as amusing as I did.]

Act I
[Apparently this is because I posted three comments on the "community" threadweaver
that had to do with ways that I thought that the movement command could be improved,
that the way that mobs in the city tended to spam movement and other echos was a bit
excessive, as well as a few other things that I had found confusing as a newbie.  Sorry,
can't remember it verbatim and it's deleted now. The following is the full result.

Have been deleted. 

That was an extremely stupid, and EXTREMELY meanspirited use of 
a tool I crafted to create hope for our community. 

You are officially on probation. 

Your board access has been revoked until you can demonstrate 
a commitment to the goals and efforts of people who have spent 
THOUSANDS of hours WORKING here. 

It's time for you to prove that you're an ASSET to the this 
project. 

If you're in any way committed to this project, then I'll expect 
to hear back from you. Till then, you're off the team.

Act II
[My response]

    Alright, we seem to have a completely different meaning to the word 
community here.  It was my understanding that the "community 
threadweaver" was a forum for discussion that includes both players 
and realmweavers, and allows both to speak their mind on issues 
dealing with Hrielith and perhaps things outside of Hrielith as well. 

I have no problem with the fact that you've deleted my posts there 
because you think that they were "meanspirited."  That's your 
perrogative.  I assure you that they were written with the purpose 
of being a player's eye view of a few of the things that I when I 
originally logged onto hrielith, which I did even before you first 
e-mailed me, found rather disconcerting and hard to understand the 
reasoning behind.  It was meant to be an opinion, nothing more. 

I would previously have written it up and posted it to the list, but 
in the instances where I did so before, you said that you didn't 
want those kind of suggestions from me posted to the list because 
you viewed them as unproductive.  So, no posting of such things to 
the orgdev list. 

Therefore it seems to me that you're saying one thing, and then 
acting upon another other.  Numerous times you've said that this 
community is open to suggestions for improvements, etc, etc.  Yet 
when I post to the orgdev list, you simply discard my suggestions as 
counterproductive.  Afterwards you ask that everyone use the list 
more. 

You open up this community threadweaver, apparently for community 
input, stories, thoughts, etc.  You ask us to join the community, 
ostensively to use it for it's purpose.  I therefore use it to post 
an opinion of some parts of the mud that didn't make sense to me, my 
perspective from playing my character.  I had no reason to think 
that just because I was a realmweaver, I shouldn't post my opinion 
there.  Evidently this is not the case.  If I had simply been a 
player putting forth my opinion, would you also have deleted my 
posts? 

In essence, I'm not asking that my voice be heard, as I can do that 
elsewhere.  I came here to learn how to code, and to create, so my 
opinion is something seperate.  [Though certainly before this month 
I haven't had much of any free-time to do either, and this has only 
recently changed for the better.]  What I do ask is that you make up 
your mind whether you want input and suggestions, or none at all. 
If you do not, then fine, I will essentially not provide any 
communication not consisting purely of data.  But don't say that 
you're looking for opinions or writing and then when I offer mine, 
snap at me.

Goodbye. Your attitude and productivity, stink.

Act IV
[A later scenario, where evidently it was necessary for my character to be deleted
in order to vent some anger.]

### Xaz the Ithrynx Wanderer is welcomed in the realm. ###

You sense you are still adjusting to your new environment...

a Candleabra was funny, Ah, the error of my horrible ways. *gkkk*]
Ok.

Act V
[A bit later]
Are you desiring a new symbiote - or to inhabit an existing one ?
[(n)ew/(l)ogin] l
Please speak the name of thy symbiont.
Xaz
Xaz? Is that right? [I.e. no character found.]

Epilogue
Anyway, it's been fun while it lasted.  I may now miss the chance of getting to know
everyone, but I suppose that that's a byproduct of deciding not to just blindly follow
orders, or trying to rationally discuss a matter of apparent contention.

You know where I am, Survive, Have fun.  Xeura, if you'd do me the favor of saying 
"Later" to Voron, really the only other person that I met on H, I'd appreciate it.  
Didn't know which one was his e-mail.  

Velph, if it's not enjoyable, then what -is- the point?

Tchal.
