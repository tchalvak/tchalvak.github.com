Applying to become an Imm again.


^rAreas built:  ^x
 
The underground fortress of the Tchalvak and Surroundings.
(linked North of Minsil)
 
^rMajor edits:  ^x
 
The city of Minsil
(overhauled all the descriptions and added new material)
 
The Tritower
(overhauled all the descriptions and added new material, though most of the
 new material is no longer available since it was later edited by Daigar)
 
Old Mortal Housing Place under the waterfall East of Visari/aka "Sybell 
House"?
 
Many many helpfiles
see:  "Help filechanges"
and:  "Help old filechanges" for a partial list.
 
And of course I've worked on revising/updating the Xaos website.
 
 
^rMinor Edits:  ^x
 
The Tritower (helped Daigar with some editing after his overhaul)
South Visari (did some work on it with Albach, though the work was later 
lost in "The Great Builder Crash".
 
 
^rUnfinished Area:  ^x
 
The Slaan Starting Location and Surroundings
Area starting at 15550 and encompassing vnums:
 
15550 to 15599
27050 to 27099
(there may be another set of vnums attached, but if so I can't remember 
its range)
 
Last I knew this area was in the "final reviews" stage, and though I tried
to get people to help it through the last bits when I was no longer an imm,
nothing ever really came of that.
