                                The Temple Ruins[Wrong, Library]
 
 
                                 -Area:-
 
        The Temple Ruins is the remains of an ancient temple, it's origins and meaning mostly lost to time, though the truth is that it once housed a dark rift to another plane and the destruction of that rift brought down the temple as well.  
        In essence, now it's like a stonehenge of broken slabs of stone that once made up the temple walls and structure.
        Below that, of course, lies Xz' area/home/thing.
 
Anyway:
        It's made up of a cross-formation of rooms, with rooms 2-5 containing only ruins, descs, E.D.s, furniture-type atmospheric objects, and some overgrown plants.  
Room 1 is centered on vmap location 45775, coord 215, 101.
Room 6 has 6 vmap rooms between it and room 5.
