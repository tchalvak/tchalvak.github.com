Herein find maps, as best maps can be rendered, of the caves wherein
dwells the spider-queen, Anasasi.  Accept the artist's apologies for
the hasty, schematic nature of these drawings, knowing that, were the
subject matter only slightly more conducive to plotting, a fully
rendered blueprint, complete with portraits of the inhabitants, would
have been made.



In this rendering of the pathways through the upper portions of the
caves mentioned above, all symbols which repeat are to be known as
signifying the identical place in all repititions, despite any rule of
logic, geometrics, or architecture which might mandate otherwise.
The entrance of the cave has been labeled as such, and the stairwell
leading to the regions inhabited by Anasasi and her children likewise.

In this rendering of the pathways through the upper portions of the
caves mentioned above, all symbols which repeat are to be known as
signifying the identical place in all repititions, despite any rule of
logic, geometrics, or architecture which might mandate otherwise.
While there was insufficient room to clearly label certain points, 
know that the symbol resembling a spider and that resembling a spiral
stairwell as viewed from above represent the lair of Anasasi herself,
and the staircase mentioned in the preceding paragraph, respectively.

and understanding on this portion of the plane of Chaos.
