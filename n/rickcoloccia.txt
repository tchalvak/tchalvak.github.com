Greetings.

Brian Kaplan told me that there might be openings for work with your department, so I'm just writing to see if you need any more help.

I'm a Sophmore here at geneseo, I worked for the CIT department a previous semester with Karen Brumm and Mary Nitsche, but I don't think that the oracle database work that they're involved with is anywhere near as generally applicable to dealing with computers compared to the experience that I think working in your department could give.
I'm very flexible to changes in hours and duties, and dependable when they are set, though I don't know how well my schedule would mesh with times that you might need.

I took a networking class at the end of high-school that put me half-way towards getting some sort of cisco networking certification, so though I have since had the time to forget quite a bit of what I knew, I learned the basics of dealing with networking issues and hardware, stripping and capping RJ45 cables, and rudiments like that.

I don't have the level of knowledge that Brian has, but I would be focused and eager to learn, even to the extent of volunteering whatever length of time it would for me to learn enough to be productive, if that is necessary.
