With more meetings between elves and the newly founded human lands there
have been instances where one of each race would marry. In most cases the
children of such marriages would be a unique blend of both worlds.  But due
to various conservative factions from both the human and elven communities
they are not always welcomed into society with open arms.  Life may be
difficult for such an enigma to adapt to both cultures, in most cases they
eventually make a choice as to which society they wish to be part of, that
is often difficult.
