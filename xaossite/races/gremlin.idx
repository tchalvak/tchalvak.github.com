Gremlins are direct offspring of kender, which in the process of a bizarre,
unholy ritual takes on a twisted shape and harder leathery skin, which
ranges from a light grey to an olive green in colour.  Many have a long
"mane" of hair that runs from just above their forehead over their skull and
as far as halfway down their back.  The colours of that hair often change in
direct reflection to the moods of the gremlin.  They dye this hair using
anything on hand, even blood, often.  Rending claws tip each of their
fingers, almost half as long as the gremlin digits and therefore their most
primal attack is a slashing one, rather than a punch.  Gremlins also have
the subtle power to breath out a toxic blast, the victim of which becomes
confused, their mind clouded by the gremlin magic, and are unable to
remember who they were fighting and what they were doing.
