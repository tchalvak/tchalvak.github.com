Avariel stand at an average of slightly less than six feet tall, and weigh
between 100 and 140 pounds. Avariel are of necessity light, allowing them to
fly unhampered. A pair of feathered wings extend from their backs, extending
in a wingspan from tip to tip of almost twelve feet, when fully extended.
Avariel skin is a much more bronzed hue than the forest elves, and their
wings are most often brown to black in color. Their hair and eyes are
usually the same colors as their surface counterparts. Spoken of from time
to time in aged tomes from before the great Crystal war, there is myth of a
race of elves that served as watchers and guardians of their society during
this time of troubles.  Referred to as the "Avariel" which literally
translates as "Winged Kin". Once the War was over, the Avariel, displeased
with their brethren and the dwarves who they fought against, seeing neither
side was victor, as the the horrific casualties of this battle were common
to both, A council of Avariel elders deemed the land dwelling elven races
"Ilaswe": the Shattered Ones, and took it upon themselves to seperate from
their tainted kin.  The texts do not declare the date, but at some point
after the war's conclusion, the Avariel mountain city of Arador tore from
it's roots and hurtled into the heavens, vanishing beyond the cover of the
clouds. Over the centuries, the Avariel have become more of a myth than a
memory to the remaining elven nations. Some who witnessed the flight,
however, believe Arador still exists, and that the Avariel merely wait,
watching for the proper time to return to Terra.
