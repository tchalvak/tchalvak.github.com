It was written that a wizard of incredible might once took the massive size
of a giant and gave it the dexterity and the cunning nature of a human. And
the writing seems true if you've ever met one of these people. Half-giants
unlike the other mixes, get along quite well with either culture and could
easily find a home among them. The humans have no quarrel with having such a
strong figure around to help out and the hill giants are never very
aggressive towards outsiders anyways.
