Trolls are large creatures with only a vaguely humanoid form, long arms and
four thick digits with strong, blunt nails at the end. Trolls are all
muscle, though whether this is normal, or just because the only fat troll is
a dead troll is uncertain. They have short tusks that extend from their
mouth, sharp teeth, and extremely leathery, hard green skin, which, with
their quick regeneration, makes them more insensitive to attacks that do not
break the skin.  However, it is said that the fire god Vulcan forced a curse
upon their race that makes them cringe at the thought of fire. Trolls almost
always wear extreme amounts of armor, usually rather plain save for their
allegiance markings, forged from the strongest metal that they can 'find'
and leather. They rarely bother with useless cloth, and in the swamps, cloth
is never needed for warmth, of course.  These large, rubbery skinned
humanoids breed in harsh swamplands or the broken tundra. Excellent
warriors, legendary for their savage tenacity and ignorance of the meaning
of pain, they form the core fighters of the Seven Tribes. They have taken
leadership of a small section of the Tribes, commonly known as the Horde, in
an extremely defensible position, the marshy swamps of what is now called
Gobold.  The few attempts to dislodge them from their swamps were met with
violent reprise, and quickly discontinued. The trolls fear growing
complacent with lack of enemy, so the fiercer of their warriors are sent to
travel the whole continent in search of the most powerful opponents and
vanquish them.  It is rumored that the 'Horde' was originally led by a small
group of orcs who were decimated by the more organized forces of the
Praetorian High-Guard before the survivors could establish themselves in the
swamps, though everyone knows that a few groups of orcs do remain, holed
away.  It is conjectured further that those who remain were part of a much
larger force. Many generations have passed, so even the few old trolls that
still roam the swamps may not know.
