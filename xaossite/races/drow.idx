Though all drow are able to advance in society, it is the females who are
dominant, as the goddess queen Aaeran reveres them. This is why only females
can fulfill the duties of Aaeran, as well as occupy all the high societal
positions. Their senses have taken the path of the hunter, hearing, smell,
and taste becoming very acute. Indeed, it is said that Drow can taste the
fear of their prey...  Their sight, however, has been all but lost by
influence of the underdark. They rely instead upon their heat-sense to guide
them in the black. Their eyes, indeed, glow with imperceptible warmth,
causing them to be able to navigate in the absence of all other sources of
light and heat.  
 
Drow have pale eyes, hair and skin, as thousands of years living underground has
left them with very little pigmentation, though often they take on the colours
of their environment, so their hair can be dark blacks, greys, silvers, purples
and blues.  Their features are very similar to that of an elf, as they all
descended from the same species.  Drow women are always very beautiful, and drow
men are always handsome and do what they can to serve the females of society.
Drow men are able to perform societal roles, however it is just more difficult
for them to climb the societal ladder, as women are favoured.

Drow in general do not fancy the others of their species, for not only does
Aaeran blame men, but the whole of the race blame their ancestral counterparts
for their underground status.  However, drow have become accustomed to the
underground, and now quite like it as they have adapted and can use it to their
best ability.

Drow have names that are elven sounding as they speak elvish, but that does
mean that they are always so.  However, each drow must identify with their House.
There are clans for each drow, or "houses."
