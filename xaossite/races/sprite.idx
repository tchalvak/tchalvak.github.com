Sprites tend to have darker skin, hair and eyes than their good winged
counterparts, though there are no limitations as any pixie or sprite
can be any colour they desire.  Because of their evil nature, sprites
tend to leave trails of faerie dust that are red or other dark colours,
which differentiates them from their wholesome counterparts. Their 
wings can be of any shape or colour, and tend to be the same colour
as the trail of faerie dust they leave behind.  There are often four
strong and very indestructible wings sprouting from their backs, and
often can be mistaken for dragon or butterflies, though it is not 
uncommon that wings take another form, as faerie creatures have an 
uncanny ability to change their appearance to suit their needs.

Sprites always have themselves in mind before others, and as a result
the natural intelligence of their faerie nature is sometimes 
overshadowed by a heightened awareness of their physical being.  In 
this respect, it is more likely that a sprite will use its physical
prowess than it is for a pixie to do the same.

They are still very intelligent creatures, and for that reason they
make excellent mages, though it is not uncommon for them to strive
to follow the ways of the Goddess as clerics.  Those who choose to
teach the ways of the Goddess are called her Voice. It is common to 
see a sprite thief, and they tend to be the most mischievous of all
the sprites.  It is rare that a sprite decide to be a warrior, for 
they do not like the stereotype often associated with those who choose
battle over the skills of the mind.
