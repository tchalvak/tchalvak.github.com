These small humanoid creatures most defining characteristic is their sense
of comradeship with the rest of their pack. Their most keen attack strategy
is to attack in swarms of overwhelming number to overtake their prey. 
Kobolds typically have very pale skin that is mostly covered in shaggy
matted hair that stands out at random from its frail body.  They are not
known for their courage or intelligence and are considered the lowest of the
tribe races, but this does not affect them as their limited grasp of the
world at large leaves little to desire from life beyond scaring the local
wildlife. There is a tight social structure among them however, the leaders
are always the strongest but even they concede to the wisdom of a shaman. 
With big saucer eyes they skulk through their home territory looking for
prey to eat and other animals so they can add to their piles of grubby
half-rotten pelts.
