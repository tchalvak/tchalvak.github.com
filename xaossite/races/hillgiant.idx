The hill giants are a pacifist culture of giants, preferring to live in
placid harmony with the beings and environment around them. They usually
live, therefore, in hilly, woodland settings, often near running water. The
hill giants have ties with the dwarves, but it is not a military alliance. 
They are famed for their neutrality, tending never to engage other groups,
and even in these times of great wars and bloodshed would rather be found in
the peaceful valley in which they have taken up residence, smoking dwarven
pipe weed and feasting upon the ample harvest of the lands. Indeed, hill
giants are only rarely compelled to leave their lush realm and travel
beyond, the reason that few are seen outside of their valley.  However, in
certain situations, hill giants become fierce warriors, most usually when
their lands or the lives of the ones that they cherish are threatened. In
such cases, hill giants are known to show their true and powerful strength,
demolishing anything that stands in their way, and ignoring all wounds done
to them, willing to sacrifice themselves for their cause.
