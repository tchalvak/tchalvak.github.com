All that is known about this mysterious race of jungle dwellers is that they
are humanoid like the orcs and their brethren, however unlike the other
humanoids you will seldom see them on marches of war or conquest.  The
Vondoni are a tribal race, settling deep within the hottest regions of the
southern jungles they can reach.  Hunting is their entire existence, and to
be a hunter within their society means eternal respect from any other
Vondoni. They are pack hunters, much like the wolves of the artic or the
domesticated hunting dogs of the other cultures. To be hunted by the Vondoni
is a death sentence while you reside anywhere within the jungles they have
marked out as thier own.  The Vondoni are very aggressive fighters who
refuse to leave a fight until all hope is lost. Because of thier hot
climate, the infravision they are gifted with works extremely well in
spotting prey from unheard of distances. As extremely good runners the
vondoni can travel for days without rest, so long as they have plenty of
meat available.  
 
The principle characteristics of the vondoni race are large canines, and a
light coat of fur that covers their othwise human features.  Standing at a
medium height, they are generally slim, giving the impression of great
endurance over long distances.  Their fur colour runs a full range of
browns.
