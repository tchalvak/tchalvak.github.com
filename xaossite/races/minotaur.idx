Once deep in the past, the noble Minotaurs ruled the northern plains and
beyond. Content to remain within that region the minotaurs had no wishes to
expand and conquest like many of the other races. Because of that they were
known as a peaceful nation with whom anyone could visit and establish
relations. That was true until one fateful day when a ship of unbelievable
size arrived at the main port to their kingdom.  It was the flagship of an
immense fleet sent from Drakko Isle to test the might of the minotaurs, and
it accomplished that goal without hesitation. Completely unprepared for the
onslaught the minotaur capital fell within minutes to the draconian shock
troops and dragon knights.  Since that moment the minotaurs have been losing
ground to the advancing Drakko armies. The only city left of the mighty
Taurian kingdom is now Harstan, so named after the Warrior-King. Minotaurs
are a strong race that holds to their code of honour until death. With a
strict military structure it is uncommon to find any minotaur that hasn't
taken up the sword in the constant wars they must now face.
