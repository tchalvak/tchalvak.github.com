Pixies can range in size depending on their chosen profession, for
ones have been seen to wield great magical weapons, while others have
chosen to increase their power through magical strength rather than
physical.  Pixies can be any colour imaginable, and their hair, eyes
and skin often change with their mood.  Because of their wholesome
nature pixies often leave trails of light coloured pixie dust, the
most common being gold, silver, pink or pale blue.  Their wings can
be of any shape or colour, and tend to be the same colour as the 
trail of faerie dust they leave behind.  There are often four strong
and very indestructible wings sprouting from their backs, and often
can be mistaken for dragon or butterflies, though it is not uncommon
that wings take another form, as faerie creatures have an uncanny 
ability to change their appearance to suit their needs.

Pixies always lean towards the fulfillment of the greater good, 
and therefore have naturally come to be very intelligent beings, 
better known for their magical abilities than their physical prowess.
However, it is not uncommon that special pixies are able to overcome
great obstacles and become very powerful in the combative skills.

Pixies make very fine mages of any sort, though they rarely use their
magic in a malicious nature.  Because of their great dedication to the
ways of the Goddess, they often play a large role in the dispersion
of her ways and values.  Those who teach the ways of the Goddess are
often called her voice.  Many pixies also choose to be thieves, though
it is often difficult for them to take anything that is not 
rightfully theirs, and therefore often choose another path.
