Centaurs appear to be a mix of horse and human, but are truly only so in
appearance.  The torso, upper body, head and arms of a centaur are look to
be the human, where as the lower body is equine or horse-like, the hair
growing denser and denser at the waist.  They have four hooves as horses do,
and so they tower over most humans, usually six and half to seven foot to
the shoulder at least.  The hair upon their head and face usually coincides
with the body, typically a brown colour, though black, white and grey are
not unheard of.  Centaurs typically don't wear much clothing, but do wear
the barding of a horse to protect their hind quarters.
