Paladins are warriors who have been inducted into a special order of
religious fighters, sworn to protect thier religion and defend its honour.
They in turn are imbued with magic normally reserved for the cleric caste
aswell as a few spells that even the clerics haven't access to.  Warriors of
either of good or evil are capable of becoming a paladin for thier cause, as
Paladins drive to further thier cause and by nature must be zealous in thier
passion neutrality is unacceptable.
