The mentalist, through great research, ageless study and painful
consolidation the two schools of magic formally known as beguilery and
clairvoyance have managed to merge into a powerful new art known as
mentalism.  The combination results in a potent foe, with absolute knowledge
and unspeakable psychic abilities.  Retaining the full abilities of both
schools this new breed of mage is quite capable of bending anything to thier
undeniable will power.
