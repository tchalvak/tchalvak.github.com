Masters of deception and the ability to make reality seem what it is not,
illusionists mix both magical trickery which deludes other's senses and true
magic, which creates a deadly combination. They, of course, can alter their
appearance at will and assume other's forms, other's voices, or they can
choose not to exist at all in other's eyes.
