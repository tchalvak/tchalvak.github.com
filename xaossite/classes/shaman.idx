The shamans are a group of spiritual figures that act as envoys to the gods,
and they perform the basic ceremonies of religious needs. They share with
clerics the imbuement of powers by their god to aid their quests and tasks.
They are often spiritual leaders within their community, though they are
not always affliated with the rituals of temples and other holy places as a
cleric would be.  Unlike clerics, they do not organize and are more likely
to work independantly in service to their diety. There are many differences
between the shaman and the cleric, the largest of which being that they do
not subscribe to the same categories of specialization.  They also trade the
ability to gain access to transportation spells, while they gain the ability
to gain affinisms.
