The Geomancer is a warrior who has undergone extreme training at the hands
of mages to be able to cast many, but not necessarily all of the basic
spells available to a mage. In effect they become a spell casting warrior,
however they have the draw back that thier training is not of course as
rigorous as a beginning mage so thier spells do tend to cost them much more
mana, which they inherently don't have as much as a mage to start.
