The Scion is the honored class of avariel warriors whom take up their spears
to defend all of Arador and its people.  Traditionally, they are the trusted
guardians of the royalty but their role has expanded to include keeping every
avariel of Arador safe from harm.  They tend to be loyal and true, holding
honor and sacred vows above their personal wants.  Any avariel warrior of the
50th level may select this class.
