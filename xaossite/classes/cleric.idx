Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes. Most of
their spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few
combat spells being far less powerful than those of mages.  However, clerics
are the best class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive
area of protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.
