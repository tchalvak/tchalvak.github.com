The Rake is a resourceful thief, one who's limits are not where others
remain. Using the libraries of rogue magicians turned rebellious spreaders
of knowledge, this breed of thief is unlike any other. Capable of wielding

wealthy students, they are a deadly mix and formidable at thier bastard
craft.
