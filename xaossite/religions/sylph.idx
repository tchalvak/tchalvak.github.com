For centuries, the avariel race honored and paid respects to those that
shared the skies with them - the dragons.  Spending the long years under
the protection of the powerful beings, avariel sought the identity of
their own Deity.  Having watched over Her chosen children since their
seperation from the rest of Terra, Sylph made Her presence known to those
of Arador when finally the ancient sages of the floating isle uncovered
her name from the holy scrolls in the Royal Archives.  Her kindness and
benevolence shed a new light upon their purpose in the world. Followers
of Sylph number few throughout Terra, but tend to be rather faithful and
loyal.  Those under Her wing often grant their skills and spells freely
to those in need, choosing to give without need of thanks.
