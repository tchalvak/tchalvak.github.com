Black Draconis, also known as Tiamat, is the Abyssal goddess of the
chromatic dragons.  She is a vengeful deity who believes in the 'purity' of
her kin and their right to control all that they survey.  Black Draconis is
worshipped on the Isle of Drakko predominantly, while smaller shrines exist
in other lands.

<b>Mythos:</b> Priests and followers of Black Draconis are urged to commit
