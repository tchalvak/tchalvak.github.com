In the forests of Terra, there is an ancient religion that has long been 
shrouded in mystery.  Known as the Shanta, this ancient worship of nature is 
believed to have started well over twelve thousand years ago.  Shanta is 
practiced by Druids and Rangers, among others, who construct makeshift 
shrines in the wilderness to honor the mysterious god of the Shanta, known 
as Korah.  This female deity is believed once to have been of human descent, 
which would explain why some of the other races do not hold her high in 
esteem.  It is said that from time to time she assumes human form, that of a 
gorgeous human female, perhaps as she was in life, and temps hunters from 
their paths or their company, and that those who follow her never return.
 
<b>Holy Symbol:</b> A silver leaf, or a silver droplet of water over a gold 
leaf.
 
<b>Spheres of Influence:</b> Nature, Animals, the Seasons
 
<b>Alignment:</b> Lawful Good
 
<b>Worshipper's Alignment:</b> Any Good
 
<b>Mythos:</b> Followers of Shanta believe in the sanctity of nature, 
and abhore the expansion of civilization into the unspoiled regions of Terra.
The faithful of Shanta try to reason with those who would build
upon the land that Serahn has granted them. Though they detest the
cutting of the southern forests near Ironhoof, the followers of
Serahn are pacifistic in most respects, though there are
chaotic offshoots of her religion which have taken up a sort of
'natures avenger' attitude in belief that man will not change
without subtle force. Believers of the Shanta would never knowingly harm
an animal or destroy a plant unles there was no other option
available to them.
 
<b>Holy Days:</b> The entire month of the harvest is reveared by
Shanta followers in the belief that without their vigilant
upholding of nature's rights Serahn would remove the fertility
from the lands. During this month, Shanta followers spend much
of their days in quiet prayer to Serahn to bring about a bountiful
harvest so that the lands will live, and give rise to new life.
It is also believed that Serahn has ties to the religion of Xaos,
as she may be responsible for the harvests that Xaos' religion claims
to create.
