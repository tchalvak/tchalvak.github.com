In the frozen wastes of the Empire of the Minotaur lies a religion bathed in
the ideals of brotherhood.  The religion is known as Taurus, and is led by
Ultor, the Minotaur God.  The religion is exclusive to the Minotaur species,
as Ultor does not truly trust any but his own species.  The religion has
changed much since its initiation.  Near one hundred years ago, the religion
supported pacifism over the promotion of war, believing that to take an
offensive posture, was to expect nothing but more wars.  During this time,
the followers of Tiamat took advantage of this, and sent a flight of white
dragons to annihilate Taurus.  The battle was hard fought, and in the end
much of the Tauran countryside lie in ruins.  Even to this day, the Tauran
minotaur suffer against the white dragons.  After the battle, Ultor
proclaimed pacifism a falsehood and a hopeless dream, and began preparing
his peoples for the upcoming war.  
 
<b>Holy Symbol:</b> A golden shield with the symbol of horns etched onto it.
 
<b>Spheres of Influence:</b> Brotherhood(Minotaur), Protection, Patron to Minotaurs.
 
<b>Alignment:</b> Chaotic Good
 
<b>Worshipper's Alignment:</b> Any good or neutral
 
<b>Mythos:</b> Followers of Taurus are strict believers in their own
destiny, and the destiny of the minotaur empire. They are fierce haters
of Tiamat and her children, and know that it is only a matter of time
before she attempts to wipe them out once more. Taurus priests
are guardians of the beseiged, and they share much in common with
priests of Crom as their god is the guardian of a seiged people.
Followers of Taurus are also taught to treat all minotaur equally
no matter what their views, as withouth the brotherhood of the horns, the
minotaur species would have been decimated.
 
<b>Holy Days:</b> The Taurus religion does not have any set holy days
since the religion's reconstruction. There were once great festivals
of the ideal of pacifism, but the war against Tiamat has destroyed that
once hopeful ideal. Priests of Taurus are expeted to observe a right of
passage at a young age though, as they must take a serious wound in
place of another's suffering to represent Ultor's willingness to suffer
for his people.
