Little is known of the ways of the Goddess, other than that she has been
worshipped by the fae since the dawn of time.  She is very protective of all
things magical, especially the pixies, sprites and brownies of the Faerie
Woods.  The Goddess offers protection to those who love and serve one
another as well as protect and preserve all things magical in her name.  She
has a particular fondess for all this beautiful and magical, and an even
greater affinity to seeing people in love.  One can gain great favour with
offerings of flowers, and she is often said to appear in the form of a nymph
before her most faithful followers.  Though it does not happen often, to
offend the Goddess is to send her into a fit of rage, where she is apt to
take from they who offended her any magical skills they possessed.  She also
does not tolerate abuse of magical power of any kind.  
 
<b>Worshipper's Alignment:</b> Any
 
<b>Religion Alignment:</b> Chaotic Good
 
<b>Holy Symbol:</b> Whatever her followers think best represents them.

<b>Spheres of Influence:</b> Faeries, The Forest, Magic, Love, Nature, Trickery
 
<b>Acts of Favour:</b> She favours most the simple offering of flowers at her altars,
though many simple objects can be given as a gift.  She also appreciates those
who follow their own goals, especially in the usage and preservation of magic.
Those who abuse her forest, or disrespect those she keeps within it will quickly
fall from favour, with consequences unpolite to speak of.
