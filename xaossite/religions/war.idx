The art of War has existed for all time.  Being a deciding factor in various
disputes it was bound to take care of those that protect it. Aethos, the god
of War originated from an unknown location in the astral plane.   Creating
the very fighting spirit that lives in all creations, he encourages combat
and knowledge. Finding a close relationship with the Caelic religion, the
followers of War are also encouraged to not only learn as much as possible
from any opponent they find themselves in combat with, but also to enhance
their knowledge and ingenuity through exploration and study.  Any cowardly
act is strongly frowned upon usually resulting in a loss of favor.   Blindly
boasting about ones own abilities yet refusing or failing to prove such
boast true is subjecting ones self to the punishment of another follower of
War.  
 
<b>Worshippers Alignment:</b> Any
 
<b>Religion Alignment:</b> True Neutral

<b>Holy Symbol:</b> Two swords crossed over a silver shield.
 
<b>Acts of Favour:</b> Fleeing from battle will result in a loss of favour. All
followers are strongly encouraged to compete with each other as well as
wel as warriors outside the religion.  Holy days are personal, usually 
any day a follwer is victorious in battle.  Should a follower refuse a 
duel, he is bound to be publically humiliated by any other follower.
