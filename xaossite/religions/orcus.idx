The demon Orcus is a blood thirsty monster from the lowest planes of 
existance, a creature of pure destruction he craves nothing more then the 
absolute domination of life itself by his twisted creations the humanoids.  
Most races that worship him were fasioned in his likeness and thrive on 
the goals he sets them upon.  Little is known of his actions or abilities 
beyond the ties to his preferred races and the guidance he installed 
through a sect of equally malicious clerics and shamen.  The chaotic beast 
has an enormous apetite for brutality and drives those that serve him into 
wars of catastrophic preportions to sate that hunger.

Orcus is prone to concerting his followers with those of other demon gods 
to carry out grand schemes, squashing the life from anything which tries 
to stand against the unholy pacts formed within the darkest reaches of 
thier world.

do one another for his obscene favour.

have thier own celebrations and times of religious piety under his banner 
which mark important times for thier culture and how Orcus shaped thier 
destinies.
