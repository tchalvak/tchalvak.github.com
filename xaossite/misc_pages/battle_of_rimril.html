The midtower [Room 12928]

  The interior of the tower is quite dark, there is only a tiny window on the
outter wall which doesn't even let you see out to well, its meant to be a
blind archer spot rather then a scenic enhancement.   You can go further up
the tower to its very top or you can go along the ramparts to the other
tower or back down to the base of the tower.

Along the rampart [Room 12927]

  The ramparts go along above the entrance to the fort, allowing a good
vantage point against anyone trying to force open the doors, also you can
see the whole street that goes through the heart of the fortress and the
guards patrolling here often look out across to scan for any trouble in
which they should assist.  A canopy has been added over the ramparts
protecting them from arrows and spells.
