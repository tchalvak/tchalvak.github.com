<font color=red>"In all things, there lies fear. In every heart,
the seeds of evil sow. In every waking moment, there
is the knowledge that dreams await. Halfway between
reality and dreams, halfway between hell and earth,
we are those shrouded in secrecy, we are those who's
names are whispered, and not spoken. We, are the shadows."
</font>
In legend, there exists an Organization who swears aligance to
the evil demon-god, the Nightmare King, Albach Ra. For
those who have seen the shadows move and heard the darkness talk
they know what lurks beyond the light. Very little is known to
be fact about this mysterious cult; some believe them all to be
demons conjured from the hells themselves, while others believe
them to be gods in their own right, working together to bring
about the end of the world.
 
Truthfully though, the Order of the Crimson Moon remains a dark
secret to all but the select few who work within its ranks.
Their names are feared throughout the lands for their incredible
power and ferocity, as well as their resourcefulness and skill.
 
It is rumored that their activities are sometimes based in
the vicinity of the endless swamp within the ghost town near Minsil,
but this could just be another myth to add to their long and
shadowy past.
