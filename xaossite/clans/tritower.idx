Watched over by the Three Archmagi and the High Council, the Tower 
is perhaps the most powerful enclave of mages on the continent of 
Terra.  It's many practitioners of the mystic arts make powerful 
keepers of the relics and treasures within it's walls, and it holds an 
unshakable place in the history of the continent of Terra.  

Though the Towers themselves are essentially impervious to 
destruction, there have been a number of instances when the magi were 
forced to abandon the tower when it was overpowered, suprised, 
or even betrayed from within.  In all cases but one, however, the 
threat was quickly eliminated. The Severance, as it was later called, 
was waged by renegade factions within the tower.  After their 
defeat, the survivors formed the Necromantic Tower.  For this reason, 
those who use the dark arts are only warily trusted within the 
Tritower.  Many necromancers have been outcaste, and others have 
voluntarily left the guild to seek power in the dark tower.
