<pre>
A collection of spellcasters, they have only one requirement for membership,
that those that wish to join can use magic.  The Circle is an open assembly,
there being few privileges to the higher ranks, mostly administrative
abilities.  The bulk of the power rests in the hands of the Firsts, who
administer justice and the Seconds, who decide upon leadership matters.  The
Leader, called the Focus, is mainly used to make the final decision in the
event of an impass.  Anyone ranked Third and up can recruit and all members
are encouraged to donate as much as they can to help further the Circle.  
The Circle has formally allied with the Tritower and Visari and the
Nagasants have agreed to fight to protect both.
