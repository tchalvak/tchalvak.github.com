From the swamps rages the monster...
from the hills howls the beast...
From the shadows strikes the sinister...
From the battle rises the Horde!
</font>
We are the right hand of Orcus, the tribes united, the very embodiment of
unwavering force.  Within the deep swamps we have festered, we have grown,
and we have become the nightmare of the known lands.  We are the true
vision of the demon gods.  Content no longer are we, content to thrive in
the swamps alone no longer, we move, we move out into the dry lands.  To
the deserts east and the icy north we charge.

Our numbers are of the true blooded horde with additions who prove they
are true in the eyes of Orcus.  The horde accepts not petitions but
instead grants invitations.
