<font color=red>Agents</font> of <font color=green>Oblivion</font>

The agents of oblivion started out as a band of mercenaries held together by an 
elf named Shinlu Graveflower.  After establishing the clan as a moderately 
powerful organization Shinlu soon fell prey to the malice of Malstasius.  He 
turned the clan over to an assassin named Gax, and gathered his riches and fled. 
Now the clan is still led by Gax, and its only members are gremlins and their 
demonic counterparts.

The Agents are therefore a very cruel band of gremlins, imps, and fiends. They 
have made the Agents much more powerful than their former leader ever could 
have. They have also made themselves very rich with their constant thieving, 
rampant looting, and murder for hire.
Little is known about what they are up to, but it is believe that they have 
their greedy little claws in just about everything, making them the top dogs of 
organized crime.  However what is known is that all thieving must go through 
them or the streets will flow with the blood of those involved.

Sightings of Gax are few and far between.  His icy presence is swift, deadly, 
and cold. An encounter with him or any of his fiendish henchmen will usually go 
their way.

This is all that is known about the Agents of Oblivion as of:
